# Use the MySQLi driver to connect to seekdb

This topic describes how to use the MySQLi driver to connect to seekdb and perform basic operations such as creating a table and inserting data.
MySQLi is an extension for the PHP language that provides both procedural and object-oriented database access methods.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed php and php-mysql.
* You have installed seekdb.

## Procedure

1. Check and install the php and php-mysql environments.
2. Create an `obtest1.php` sample file and configure the database connection information.
3. Run the `obtest1.php` file and verify the results.

### Step 1: Check and install the php and php-mysql environments

Install the PHP and php-mysql environments. For more information, see [Connect to seekdb by using the Ext driver](100.ext-driver-connects-to-seekdb.md) **Step 1: Check and install the php and php-mysql environments.**

### Step 2: Modify the database connection information in the obtest1.php file

In a Linux environment, you can use the `vi obtest1.php` or `vim obtest1.php` command to edit the `obtest1.php` file and modify the database connection information to match your actual setup.

Here is an example:

```shell
[root]# vim obtest1.php
<?php
$servername = "11.158.xx.xx";
$port = "2881";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "test";

// Create a connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname, $port);

// Check if the connection is successful
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Create a table
$sql = "CREATE TABLE myguests (
id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
firstname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
lastname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(50),
reg_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Table myguests created successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error creating table: " . $conn->error;
}

// Insert data
$sql = "INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com')";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "New record inserted successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error inserting data: " . $conn->error;
}

// Query the table
$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM MyGuests";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // Output data
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["firstname"]. " " . $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}

// Drop the table
$sql = "DROP TABLE myguests";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Table myguests dropped successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error dropping table: " . $conn->error;
}

// Close the connection
$conn->close();
?>
```

Where:

* `$servername` specifies the address of the seekdb server.
* `$port` specifies the port number of the seekdb server.
* `$username` specifies the username of the seekdb user.
* `$password` specifies the password for connecting to seekdb.
* `$dbname` specifies the name of the database to connect to.

### Step 3: Run the obtest1.php file and verify the results

Run the `obtest1.php` file by executing the `php obtest1.php` command to verify the connection to seekdb and check whether the basic operations such as creating a table and inserting data are successful.

Here is an example:

```shell
[root]# php obtest1.php
Table myguests created successfullyNew record inserted successfullyid: 1 - Name: John Doe<br>Table myguests dropped successfully
```
