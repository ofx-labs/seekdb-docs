# EXT driver connects to seekdb

This topic describes how to use the EXT driver to connect to seekdb and perform basic operations such as creating a table and inserting data.
EXT is a PHP extension for a specific purpose, such as database access.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed PHP and the PHP MySQL extension.
* You have installed seekdb.

## Procedure

1. Check whether the PHP and PHP MySQL environment is installed.
2. Create an `obtest.php` sample file and configure the database connection information.
3. Run the `obtest.php` file and verify the result.

### Step 1: Check whether the PHP and PHP MySQL environment is installed

Run the following command to install the PHP environment.

```shell
sudo yum install php
sudo yum install php-mysql
```

Run the following command to check whether the PHP environment is installed.

```shell
[root]# php -v
PHP 5.4.16 (cli) (built: Dec 13 2015 00:05:14)
Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.4.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies
```

### Step 2: Configure the database connection information in the obtest.php file

In a Linux environment, you can run the `vi obtest.php` or `vim obtest.php` command to edit the `obtest.php` file and configure the database connection information in the file.

Here is an example:

```shell
[root]# vim obtest.php
<?php
$servername = "172.30.xxx.xxx";
$port = "2881";
$username = "root";
$password = "xxxx";
$dbname = "test";

// Create a connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname, $port);

// Check whether the connection is successful
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
echo "Connection succeeded";
?>
```

where:

* `$servername` specifies the server address.
* `$username` specifies the username for connecting to the database.
* `$password` specifies the password for connecting to the database.
* `$dbname` specifies the name of the database to connect to.

### Step 3: Run the obtest.php file and verify the result

Run the `php obtest.php` command. If the command fails, the following message is returned:

```shell
[root]# php obtest.php
PHP Warning:  mysqli_connect(): (42000/1045): Access denied for user 'root'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (using password: YES) in /home/admin/obtest.php on line 9
Connection failed: Access denied for user 'root'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (using password: YES)
```

If you enter the correct password, the following message is returned:

```shell
[root]# php obtest.php
Connection succeeded
```

You can test table creation and data insertion, modification, and deletion. Here is an example:

```shell
[root]# vim obtest.php
<?php
$servername = "172.30.xxx.xxx"; // Server address
$port = "2881";
$username = "root"; // Username
$password = "xxxxxxx"; // Password
$dbname = "test"; // Database name

// Create a connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname, $port);

// Check whether the connection is successful
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Create a table
$sql = "CREATE TABLE myguests (
id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
firstname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
lastname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(50),
reg_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)";
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
    echo "Table myguests created successfully";
} else {
    echo "Table creation failed: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

// Insert data
$sql = "INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com')";
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
    echo "New record inserted successfully";
} else {
    echo "Data insertion failed: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

// Close the connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

If the command is executed successfully, the following result is returned:

```shell
[root]# php obtest.php
Table myguests created successfullyNew record inserted successfullyid: 1 - Name: John Doe<br>Table myguests deleted successfully
```
