# Overview of vector embedding

This topic provides an overview of the concepts and usage of vector embedding.

## What is vector embedding?

Vector embedding is a technique that converts unstructured data into numerical vectors. These vectors capture the semantic information of unstructured data, allowing computers to "understand" and process the meaning of unstructured data. Specifically:

* Vector embedding maps unstructured data such as text, images, and audio/video into points in a high-dimensional vector space.
* In this vector space, semantically similar unstructured data are mapped to nearby positions.
* Vectors are typically composed of hundreds of numbers (such as 512 dimensions or 1024 dimensions).
* The similarity between vectors can be calculated using mathematical methods such as cosine similarity.
* Common vector embedding models include Word2Vec, BERT, BGE, and so on. For example, when developing a RAG application, we usually need to embed text data into vector data and store it in a vector database, while other structured data are stored in a relational database.

seekdb allows you to store vector data as a data type in a relational table, enabling efficient and organized storage of both vector and traditional scalar data in seekdb.

## How to generate vector embeddings

In seekdb, you can generate vector embeddings in the following two ways:

| Method | Description | Advantages | Differences |
|------|------|------|------|
| [Use the AI_EMBED function](200.ai-embed-function.md) | Use the built-in AI function service of the database without installing additional dependencies. | Simple and convenient, with direct SQL calls. | **Currently only supports text embeddings.** |
| [Use an external embedding model](300.external-embedding-models.md) | Use external models such as Sentence Transformers, Ollama, and online APIs. | Offers more flexibility and supports a wider range of models. | Supports generating vector embeddings from various data sources, including text, images, and more. |
