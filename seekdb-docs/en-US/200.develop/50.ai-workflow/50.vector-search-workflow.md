# AI application workflow using seekdb vector search

This topic describes the AI application workflow using seekdb vector search.

## Convert unstructured data into feature vectors through vector embedding

Unstructured data (such as videos, documents, and images) is the starting point of the entire workflow. Various forms of unstructured data, including videos, text files (documents), and images, are transformed into vector representations through vector embedding models. The task of these models is to convert raw, unstructured data that is difficult to directly calculate similarity into high-dimensional vector data. These vectors capture the semantic information and features of the data, and can express the similarity of data through distances in the vector space. For more information, see [Vector embedding technology](../500.vector-embedding/100.vector-embedding-overview.md).

## Store vector embeddings and create vector indexes in seekdb

As the core storage layer, seekdb is responsible for storing all data. This includes traditional relational tables (used for storing business data), the original unstructured data, and the vector data generated after vector embedding.

To enable efficient vector search, seekdb internally builds vector indexes for the vector data. Vector indexes are specialized data structures that significantly accelerate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional vector spaces. Since calculating vector similarity is computationally expensive, exact searches (calculating distances for all vectors one by one) ensure accuracy but can severely impact query performance. Through vector indexes, the system can quickly locate candidate vectors, significantly reducing the number of vectors that need distance calculations, thereby improving query efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. For more information, see [Vector indexes](../600.search/300.vector-search/200.vector-index/100.vector-index-overview.md).

## Perform nearest neighbor search and hybrid search through SQL/SDK

seekdb supports interaction with AI applications through SDKs, allowing users to submit queries that may involve text, images, or other formats. For more information, see [pyseekdb](../../450.reference/900.sdk/10.pyseekdb-sdk/10.pyseekdb-sdk-get-started.md).

seekdb uses SQL statements to query and manage relational data, enabling hybrid searches that combine scalar and vector data. When a user initiates a query—if it is unstructured—the system first converts it into a vector using the embedding model. Then, leveraging both vector and scalar indexes, the system quickly retrieves the most similar vectors that also meet scalar filter conditions, thus identifying the most relevant unstructured data. For detailed information about nearest neighbor search, see [Nearest neighbor search](../600.search/300.vector-search/300.vector-similarity-search.md).

## Generate prompts and send them to the LLM for inference

In the final stage, an optimized prompt is generated based on the hybrid search results and sent to the large language model (LLM) to complete the inference process. The LLM generates a natural language response based on this contextual information. There is a feedback loop between the LLM and the vector embedding model, meaning that the output of the LLM or user feedback can be used to optimize the embedding model, creating a cycle of continuous learning and improvement.
