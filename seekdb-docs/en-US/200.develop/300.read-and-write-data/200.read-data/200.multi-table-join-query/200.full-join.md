# FULL JOIN

A full join is a type of outer join. It returns all rows from both tables, regardless of whether they match.

## Background information

An outer join compares data from two tables using a comparison operator. The result of an outer join includes rows that match the join condition and rows that do not match the join condition.

Outer joins include full joins, left joins, and right joins. An outer join returns all rows that satisfy the join condition and any unmatched rows from one of the tables, with `NULL` values in the corresponding columns of the other table.

This topic provides examples of full joins. For examples of left joins, see [LEFT JOIN](300.left-join.md). For examples of right joins, see [RIGHT JOIN](400.right-join.md).

## FULL JOIN syntax

In an outer join statement, the left table appears on the left side of the `JOIN` clause, and the right table appears on the right side of the `JOIN` clause.

The syntax for a full join is as follows:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name1 FULL JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition
[ WHERE query_condition ]
[ ORDER BY column_list ];
```

In this syntax, `table_name1` is the left table, and `table_name2` is the right table.

## Examples

Create sample tables and insert appropriate data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl_a(id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

CREATE TABLE tbl_b(number INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, value INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

INSERT INTO tbl_a VALUES(1,'ab'),(2,'cd'),(3,'ef'),(4,'gh');
Query OK, 4 rows affected
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

INSERT INTO tbl_b VALUES(1,1001),(3,1003),(5,1005);
Query OK, 4 rows affected
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Simple full join query

In a full join query, if a row in the left table or the right table does not have a matching row, the system automatically fills the corresponding columns with `NULL`.

Example: Perform a full join on tables `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` and obtain the query result.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

SELECT * FROM tbl_a FULL JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    1 | ab   |      1 |  1001 |
|    2 | cd   |   NULL |  NULL |
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
|    4 | gh   |   NULL |  NULL |
| NULL | NULL |      5 |  1005 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
5 rows in set
```

As you can see, there is no row in table `tbl_a` with a value of `5`. In the query result, the corresponding column is filled with `NULL`. Similarly, there are no rows in table `tbl_b` with values of `2` or `4`. In the query result, these two rows are filled with `NULL`.

### Use a full join with a WHERE clause

You can use a full join to obtain the join result and then use a `WHERE` clause to filter the join result.

Example 2: Perform a full join on tables `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` and return the data in `tbl_b` where `value=1003`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

SELECT * FROM tbl_a FULL JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number WHERE tbl_b.value=1003;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
1 row in set
```
