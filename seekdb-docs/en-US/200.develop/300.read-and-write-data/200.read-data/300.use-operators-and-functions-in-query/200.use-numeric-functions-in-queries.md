# Use numeric functions in queries

This topic provides an example of how to use numeric functions in queries.

## Numeric functions

Common numeric functions include the SUM() function, which calculates the sum of values; the AVG() function, which calculates the average of values; the CEIL() function, which rounds a value up; the FLOOR() function, which rounds a value down; and the ROUND() function, which rounds a value to the nearest integer.

## Example

Create the toys_order table and insert order data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE toys_order (
  order_id     INTEGER,
  toy_id       INTEGER,
  toy_dealer   VARCHAR(20),
  toy_price    DECIMAL(10, 2),
  toy_amount   INTEGER
);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

INSERT INTO toys_order VALUES ( 1001,1, 'A',53.12,100 ),( 1002,2, 'A',24.8,190 ),( 1003,3, 'A',19.9,330)
      ,( 1004,1, 'B',53.12,50 ),( 1005,2, 'B',24.8,200 ),( 1006,3, 'B',19.9,350 ),( 1007,2, 'A',24.8,100 );
7 rows in set
```

### Use numeric functions in queries

Use the `SUM()`, `ROUND()`, and `AVG()` functions to query the total sales and average sales per order for each toy.

```sql
SELECT toy_id
    , SUM(toy_amount)                sum_amount
    , ROUND(avg(toy_amount),4)       avg_amount
    FROM toys_order GROUP BY toy_id  ORDER BY toy_id;
+--------+------------+------------+
| toy_id | sum_amount | avg_amount |
+--------+------------+------------+
|      1 |        150 |     75.000 |
|      2 |        490 |    163.333 |
|      3 |        680 |    340.000 |
+--------+------------+------------+
3 rows in set
```
