# Delete data

After you insert data into a table, you can use the `DELETE` statement or other statements to delete records from the table. This topic describes how to use these statements and provides examples.

## Prepare for data deletion

Before you delete data from a table, make sure that the following conditions are met:

* You have connected to seekdb. For more information, see [Overview of connection methods](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000002013253).

* You have the `DELETE` privilege on the table. If you want to use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to delete all data from the table, you also need the `CREATE` privilege on the table. For more information about how to view the privileges of the current user, see [View user privileges](../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/400.view-user-permissions.md). If you do not have the required privileges, contact your administrator to grant them. For more information about how to directly grant privileges, see [Directly grant privileges](../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.direct-authority.md).

## Delete data by using the DELETE statement

You can use the [DELETE](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000002017032) statement to delete some or all data from a table.

In addition to the `DELETE` statement, the `REPLACE INTO` statement may also delete data. For more information about the `REPLACE INTO` statement, see [Replace data](400.replace-data-in-develop.md).

The syntax of a simple `DELETE` statement is as follows:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name [ WHERE condition ] ;
```

|          Parameter           | Required |                Description                                    |
|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| table_name              | Yes      | The name of the table from which you want to delete data.                                     |
| [ WHERE condition ]     | No      | The condition clause specifies the conditions that the data to be deleted must meet. If you do not specify this clause, all data in the table is deleted. |

### Delete some data

You can use the `DELETE` statement with the `WHERE` clause to delete some data from a table.

The following example deletes all rows from the `t_insert` table where the `value` column is equal to 10004:

```sql
DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value = 10004;
Query OK, 1 row affected
```

### Delete all data

If the amount of data in a table is small, you can use the `DELETE` statement to delete all rows from the table.

Example:

* Delete all rows from the `t_insert` table.

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM t_insert;
  Query OK, 3 row affected
  ```

  If the table contains more than one million data records, executing a single `DELETE` statement may cause performance issues. In this case, we recommend that you use the `WHERE` clause to delete data in batches or directly **use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to delete all data from the table**.

* Filter the `t_insert` table based on the `value` column and execute multiple statements to delete data in batches where `value < 10000`, `value < 20000`, and `value < 30000`.

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 100000;

  DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 200000;

  DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 300000;
  ```

## Use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to delete all data from a table

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement deletes all data from a specified table but retains the table structure, including partitioning information defined in the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to a `DELETE FROM` statement that deletes all rows.

The syntax of the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement is as follows:

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name;
```

The following example deletes all data from the `t_insert` table by using the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE t_insert;
```

For more information about the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, see [TRUNCATE TABLE](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000002017016).
