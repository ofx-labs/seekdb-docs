# Create a database

This topic describes how to create a database by using SQL statements. It also provides the prerequisites, database overview, limitations, and recommendations for creating a database, and gives some examples.

## Database overview

In seekdb, a database contains tables, indexes, and metadata of database objects. We recommend that you do not use the default database, such as the `test` database, in a production environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a database, make sure that the following conditions are met:

* You have deployed seekdb. For more information about how to deploy seekdb, see [Overview](../../400.guides/400.deploy/50.deploy-overview.md).

* You have connected to seekdb.

* You have the `CREATE` privilege. For more information about how to view the privileges of the current user, see [View user privileges](../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/400.view-user-permissions.md). If you do not have this privilege, contact the administrator to grant it to you. For more information about how to directly grant privileges to a user, see [Directly grant privileges](../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.direct-authority.md).

## Limitations

* In seekdb, the name of each database must be globally unique.
* The length of a database name cannot exceed 128 characters.
* A database name can contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dollar signs, and Chinese characters.
* You cannot use reserved keywords as database names.

    For more information about the reserved keywords of seekdb, see [Reserved keywords](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001970988).

## Recommendations

* We recommend that you name the database in a meaningful way to reflect its purpose and content. For example, you can name the database **`Application Identifier_Subapplication Name (Optional)_db`**.
* We recommend that you create the database and related users by using the `root` user and grant only the necessary privileges to ensure the security and controllability of the database.
* When you create a database, set appropriate default character sets and collations to ensure the correct storage and sorting of data. To accommodate the long-term development of your business, we recommend that you use the `utf8mb4` character set to store most characters.
* You can create a database with a name that consists only of digits by enclosing the name in backticks (`). However, this is not recommended because such names are not meaningful and require backticks (`) when they are queried, which can cause unnecessary complexity and confusion.

  For more information about the character set encoding supported by the database, see [Database-level character set](../../450.reference/200.sql/100.sql-syntax/100.basic-elements/300.character-set-and-collation/400.specify-character-set-and-collation.md).

## Use the CLI to create a database

Run the [CREATE DATABASE](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001974111) statement to create a database.

The syntax of the `CREATE DATABASE` statement is as follows:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name [database_option_list];
```

**Parameters:**

* `database_name`: the name of the database.
* `database_option_list`: the list of options for setting the characteristics, behaviors, and attributes of the database, such as the character set and collation.

:::info

You can run the `SHOW DATABASES;` statement to view the databases.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a database and specify the character set

Create a database named `test_db` and specify the character set as `utf8mb4`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
```

### Example 2: Create a read-only database

Create a read-only database named `test_ro_db`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_ro_db READ ONLY;
```

### Example 3: Create a read/write database

Create a read/write database named `test_rw_db`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_rw_db READ WRITE;
```

## What to do next

After you create a database, you can perform the following common operations:

* Create the required tables in the database and define the structure and fields of the tables. For more information about how to create tables, see [Create a table](30.create-table-in-develop.md).
