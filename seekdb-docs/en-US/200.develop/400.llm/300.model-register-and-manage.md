# Register and manage AI models and endpoints

This topic describes how to register and manage AI models and endpoints in seekdb.

## Register and manage AI models and endpoints by using the system package

The `DBMS_AI_SERVICE` package provides the ability to manage AI models and endpoints. It supports the following operations:

| **Operation** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
| CREATE_AI_MODEL | Creates an AI model object. |
| DROP_AI_MODEL | Drops an AI model object. |
| CREATE_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT | Creates an AI model endpoint object. |
| ALTER_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT | Modifies an AI model endpoint object. |
| DROP_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT | Drops an AI model endpoint object. |

You can call this system package to directly manage AI models and endpoints in seekdb without relying on external services. For more information about the parameters and syntax, see [DBMS_AI_SERVICE](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000004018307).
