# AI function call permissions

This topic describes the `ACCESS AI MODEL` permission for calling AI functions. The `ACCESS AI MODEL` permission allows you to call the `AI_COMPLETE`, `AI_EMBED`, `AI_RERANK`, and `AI_PROMPT` functions.

## Prerequisites

To call an AI function, you must have the `AI MODEL` permission. This is because registering an AI model and endpoint requires the `AI MODEL` permission. After you register an AI model and endpoint, you can call an AI function. For more information about the `AI MODEL` permission, see [Manage model permissions](../400.llm/200.model-service-permission.md). For information about how to register and manage an AI model, see [Register and manage an AI model](../400.llm/300.model-register-and-manage.md).

## Syntax

The syntax for granting the `ACCESS AI MODEL` permission is as follows:

```sql
GRANT ACCESS AI MODEL ON *.* TO 'username'@'host';
```

The syntax for revoking the `ACCESS AI MODEL` permission is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE ACCESS AI MODEL ON *.* FROM 'username'@'host';
```

## Examples

1. Call the `AI_COMPLETE` function.

    ```sql
    SELECT AI_COMPLETE("ob_complete","You are a translation master. Please translate the following text into English: {{Hello world.}}, and output only the translation result.") as ans;
    ```

    The following error is returned because the `ACCESS AI MODEL` permission is not granted to the current user:

    ```shell
    ERROR 42501: Access denied; you need (at least one of) the access ai model endpoint privilege(s) for this operation
    ```

2. Grant the `ACCESS AI MODEL` permission to the `test_ai_user` user.

    ```sql
    GRANT ACCESS AI MODEL ON *.* TO test_ai_user@'%';
    ```

3. Verify the permission.

    ```sql
    SELECT AI_COMPLETE("ob_complete","You are a translation master. Please translate the following text into English: {{Hello world.}}, and output only the translation result.") as ans;
    ```

    The execution succeeds.

    ```sql
    ```shell
    +----------------+
    | ans            |
    +----------------+
    | "Hello world." |
    +----------------+
    1 row in set
    ```
