# Overview

AI Function Service is an AI-native capability provided by seekdb, allowing you to directly integrate AI model capabilities into data processing within the database using SQL expressions.

## Components

The AI Function Service consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----|------|
| **Permissions Management** | Manages `AI MODEL` and `ACCESS AI MODEL` permissions for managing AI models and calling AI functions. For more information, see [AI Function Service Permissions](100.ai-function-permission.md) and [Model Permissions Management](../400.llm/200.model-service-permission.md). |
| **Model Management** | Registers, configures, and manages AI models and endpoints, which are prerequisites for calling AI functions. For more information, see [Model Registration and Management](../400.llm/300.model-register-and-manage.md). |
| **AI Functions** | SQL expressions for calling AI capabilities, including functions such as `AI_COMPLETE`, `AI_EMBED`, `AI_RERANK`, and `AI_PROMPT`. |

:::tip
Before using the AI Function Service, ensure that you have registered AI models and endpoints.

The AI functions supported by seekdb are as follows:

| Function | Description |
|-----|------|
|`AI_COMPLETE`|Calls a specified text generation large model to process prompts and data, and parses the results. For more information, see [Text Generation AI Functions](200.text-generation-function.md).|
| `AI_PROMPT` |Builds and formats prompts, supporting dynamic data insertion. For more information, see [Text Generation AI Functions](200.text-generation-function.md).|
|`AI_EMBED`|Calls an embedding model to convert text data into vector data. For more information, see [Use the AI_EMBED Function](../500.vector-embedding/200.ai-embed-function.md).|
|`AI_RERANK`|Calls a reranking model to sort text based on prompts. For more information, see [Reranking Search](../600.search/600.ai-rerank.md).|

The process for using the AI Function Service is as follows:

1. Grant users the necessary permissions to manage AI models and call AI functions.
2. Register AI models and endpoints.
3. Call AI functions in SQL.
