# seekdb TPC-H benchmark report

This topic describes the test plan, test environment, and detailed results for a TPC-H benchmark run on seekdb.

## Test plan

* Two machines are used for this benchmark. The TPC-H tools run on one machine, and seekdb runs on the other. The seekdb host is configured with 4 vCPUs and 8 GB memory. The log disk, clog disk, and data disk are separate disks with PL1 performance level.

* The test data size is 10 GB.

For step-by-step instructions, see [TPC-H benchmark test for seekdb](100.use-tpc-h-to-test-the-performance-of-seekdb.md).

## Test environment

This benchmark uses Alibaba Cloud ECS as an example environment. seekdb runs on an ECS instance with 4 vCPUs and 8 GB memory.

* When seekdb runs on a 4 vCPU / 8 GB ECS instance, the hardware configuration and software versions are as follows:

  * Hardware configuration

    | Service type | ECS type        | Instances | vCPUs | Memory |
    |-------------|------------------|-----------|-------|--------|
    | seekdb       | ecs.c8i.xlarge   | 1         | 4C    | 8G     |

  * Software versions

    | Component | Version |
    |----------|---------|
    | seekdb    | seekdb 1.0.1 |
    | TPC-H     | V3.0.0 |
    | OS        | CentOS Linux 7 (Core) |

## Test results

This benchmark covers the 10 GB data scale. All queries are executed with a concurrency of 4.
