# seekdb MLDR benchmark report

This report summarizes the **test plan**, **test environment**, and **benchmark results** for the seekdb MLDR evaluation.

## Test plan

- Two machines are used:
  - One machine runs MLDR.
  - The other machine runs seekdb (4C8G). The log disk, clog disk, and data disk are placed on three separate disks, with performance level PL1.
- Dataset size: 200,000 records.
- The MLDR dataset is used to evaluate seekdb retrieval quality.

For step-by-step instructions, see [seekdb MLDR benchmark](100.mldr-test-of-seekdb.md).

## Test environment

This benchmark was run on Alibaba Cloud ECS. The seekdb instance size is 4C8G.

### Hardware

| Service | ECS instance type | Count | vCPU | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| seekdb | ecs.c8i.xlarge | 1 | 4C | 8G |

### Software

| Service | Version |
| --- | --- |
| seekdb | seekdb 1.0.1 |
| OS | CentOS Linux 7 (Core) |

## Results

All MLDR results below are **best-case response times after warm-up** under a **single-threaded** setup. Results are returned with `limit 1000`.

| Backend | Query type |
| --- | --- |
| seekdb | dense+bm25: <ul><li>ndcg@10 = 0.6329</li><li>recall@10 = 0.7425</li><li>rt = 150.39 ms</li></ul> |
