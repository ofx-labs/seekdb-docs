# Permission types

This topic describes the permission types of seekdb.

## Privilege levels

The privileges of seekdb are divided into three levels:

* Global privileges: These privileges affect the entire seekdb system, such as modifying system settings and accessing all tables.
* Database privileges: These privileges affect all objects in a specific database, such as creating and deleting tables in the database and accessing tables.
* Object privileges: These privileges affect specific objects, such as accessing a specific table, view, or index.

The following table lists the privileges in seekdb.
