# seekdb Agent Skill plugin

In the era of AI-assisted development, developers increasingly rely on intelligent tools to speed up coding. But when you work with a specific technology stack, such as the seekdb vector database, general-purpose assistants often lack domain context and may produce inaccurate guidance.

To address this, OceanBase provides **seekdb Agent Skill plugin**: an Agent Skills plugin designed for **Claude Code**. It allows Claude Code to retrieve seekdb official documentation so you can get accurate, best-practice guidance without leaving your terminal workflow.

## What is seekdb Agent Skill plugin?

The **seekdb Claude Code** plugin is an Agent Skills plugin. It enables Claude Code to retrieve and reference seekdb official documentation so it can:

- Understand seekdb concepts such as vector search, hybrid search, and AI functions.
- Provide accurate code suggestions based on official best practices.
- Answer seekdb questions directly from your terminal workflow.
- Speed up development by reducing time spent searching documentation.

## Core features

- **Two-command install**: Install quickly from the Claude Code plugin marketplace.
- **Works out of the box**: Minimal configuration required.
- **Comprehensive documentation support**: Uses the full seekdb documentation set (vector search, hybrid search, AI functions, and more).
- **Fast document retrieval**: Searches documentation by content to locate the most relevant references.
- **Dual-mode sourcing**: Prefers the latest docs from GitHub and falls back to local docs when needed.
- **Automatic invocation**: Claude Code automatically uses the seekdb skill when relevant—no manual triggering required.

## How it works

seekdb Agent Skill plugin is built on Anthropic's Agent Skills framework:

- **Skill injection**: The plugin injects seekdb documentation and skill metadata into Claude Code.
- **Automatic invocation**: When you ask seekdb-related questions, Claude Code detects the context and applies the seekdb skill automatically.
- **Grounded retrieval**: Claude Code uses a documentation index to locate relevant references and answer with higher accuracy without interrupting your development flow.

## About Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's terminal-based AI coding assistant. It runs directly in your development environment and helps you understand codebases, write code, fix bugs, and perform common development tasks.

Unlike typical IDE plugins, Claude Code is a standalone CLI tool with these strengths:

- **Terminal-native**: Fits naturally into your existing workflow.
- **Codebase-aware**: Can analyze and reason over an entire repository.
- **Natural-language interface**: You describe what you want; it helps you do it.
- **Multi-tool capability**: Can read/write files, execute commands, and search code.

## About Agent Skills

[Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic for adding capabilities and domain knowledge to AI agents. In practice, a skill is a folder containing instructions, scripts, and resources that an agent can discover and use to complete tasks more accurately.

Agent Skills make it possible to package domain expertise and workflows as reusable modules:

- **Automatic invocation**: Claude Code uses skills automatically based on context.
- **Modular design**: Each skill is maintained independently, making organization easier.
- **Team sharing**: Share skills via Git for consistent workflows and knowledge.
- **Composability**: Combine multiple skills to solve more complex tasks.

## Installation and configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

- Node.js 18 or later is installed.
- You can access GitHub (required for installation and fetching the latest docs).

### Step 1: Install Claude Code

If you have not installed Claude Code yet, install it globally with npm:

```shell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Step 2: Configure environment variables

Claude Code requires an API key to run. Set the following environment variables:

```shell
# Required: API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Optional: API base URL (only if you use a proxy or a custom endpoint)
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"
```

:::info
To persist these settings, add them to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or another shell startup file.
:::

### Step 3: Configure network access

Because the seekdb skill plugin fetches the latest documentation from GitHub, you need to allow Claude Code to make network requests in your project.

In your project root directory, create or edit `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "skipWebFetchPreflight": true
}
```

:::info
Setting `skipWebFetchPreflight` to `true` skips the preflight check for network requests and allows Claude Code to fetch remote documentation directly. If GitHub is unreachable, the plugin will automatically fall back to local documentation.
:::

### Step 4: Install the seekdb plugin

After starting Claude Code, run:

1. Add the seekdb Marketplace:

    ```shell
    /plugin marketplace add oceanbase/seekdb-ecology-plugins
    ```

2. Install the seekdb plugin:

    ```shell
    /plugin install seekdb-plugin@seekdb
    ```

3. Restart Claude Code.

    After installation, restart Claude Code to ensure the plugin loads correctly.

## Usage examples

Once installed, you can ask Claude Code seekdb questions in natural language, for example:

- **Getting started**
  - "How do I get started with seekdb?"
  - "What deployment modes does seekdb support?"
- **Technical questions**
  - "How do I create a vector index in seekdb?"
  - "How does hybrid search work in seekdb?"
- **Code examples**
  - "Show a hybrid search example using the seekdb Python SDK."
  - "How do I use the AI_EMBED function to convert text into vectors?"
- **Integrations**
  - "How do I integrate seekdb with LangChain?"
  - "How do I configure Jina models for vector embeddings in seekdb?"

Claude Code will detect that your question is seekdb-related, retrieve relevant documentation, and answer accordingly.

## Best practices

- **Be specific**: The more specific your question, the easier it is to retrieve the right doc references.
- **Ask follow-ups**: Use follow-up questions to drill into details.
- **Request examples**: Ask for code samples, configuration snippets, or step-by-step guidance.
- **Combine topics**: Ask questions that connect multiple seekdb features.

## Troubleshooting

### The plugin is not working

1. Verify installation: run `/plugin` in Claude Code and confirm `seekdb-plugin` is installed.
2. Restart Claude Code: fully exit and restart the Claude Code session.
3. Check environment variables: ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly.

### Cannot fetch remote documentation

1. Check network connectivity: make sure GitHub is reachable.
2. Check configuration: verify `"skipWebFetchPreflight": true` is present in `.claude/settings.local.json`.
3. Use local docs: if the network is unavailable, the plugin will automatically use local documentation.

### Update the plugin

To update to the latest version:

```shell
/plugin
```

Select **Manage marketplaces**, choose the seekdb marketplace, then press `u` to update.

## Summary

With seekdb Agent Skill plugin, you can get seekdb official documentation support directly inside Claude Code, whether you are learning new features or troubleshooting issues during development. This "AI + domain knowledge base" approach represents a practical shift in AI-assisted development: accurate guidance without context switching across multiple documentation sites.
