# seekdb Cursor Extension

In the era of AI-assisted programming, developers increasingly rely on intelligent IDEs to improve development efficiency. However, when using specific technology stacks like the seekdb vector database, AI assistants often lack domain-specific knowledge, making it difficult to provide accurate code suggestions and assistance. To address this issue, OceanBase provides the seekdb Cursor Extension, a plugin designed for the Cursor editor that integrates seekdb's official documentation into the Cursor AI assistant, equipping it with the expertise needed for seekdb database development.

## Background

### What is Cursor?

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that supports Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Cursor comes with a powerful AI assistant that helps developers:

* Smart code completion: Automatically completes code based on context.
* Code generation: Generate code from natural language descriptions.
* Code interpretation and refactoring: Understand and optimize existing code.
* Q&A interaction: Directly interact with AI to solve programming problems.

Developers can provide additional knowledge and rules to the AI assistant through the `.cursor/rules` directory, enabling it to better understand specific technology stacks. For more information about Cursor rules, see [Cursor rules documentation](https://cursor.com/cn/docs/context/rules).

## Introduction to seekdb Cursor Extension

**seekdb Cursor Extension** is a Cursor editor extension that allows the AI assistant to access seekdb's official documentation by configuring Cursor Rules. This extension enables the AI assistant to:

* Understand seekdb database concepts: Vector search, hybrid search, AI functions, etc.
* Provide accurate code suggestions: Generate code that follows best practices based on the official documentation.
* Answer seekdb-related questions: Directly access technical support within the editor.
* Accelerate the development process: Reduce the time spent looking up documentation and focus on business logic.

### Core components

| File/Directory | Description |
|-----------|------|
| .cursor/rules/seekdb.mdc | The AI assistant behavior rules file, defining two-layer access strategies and document reference specifications |
| .cursor/rules/seekdb-docs/ | Local document cache directory, serving as a backup data source when GitHub is inaccessible |

After installing and enabling the extension, it will copy the `seekdb.mdc` rule file and the complete seekdb documentation to your project's `.cursor/rules` directory. The AI assistant will prioritize fetching the latest documentation from GitHub; if the network is unavailable, it will automatically switch to the local documentation, ensuring you always have access to help.

## Install the plugin

Install it from the Cursor extension marketplace. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Cursor editor.

2. Click the extension icon at the top of the sidebar, or use the shortcut:

   * Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+X`
   * macOS: `Cmd+Shift+X`

3. In the search box, enter "seekdb".

4. Find the "seekdb" extension and click **Install**.

## Key features

### One-click addition of seekdb documentation

You can easily add seekdb's official documentation to your current project with a simple command:

Steps:

1. Open the command panel:

   * Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   * macOS: Press `Cmd+Shift+P`

2. Enter "seekdb Docs" or "Add seekdb Docs"
3. Select the `Add seekdb Docs` command

The documentation will be automatically added to:

* `.cursor/rules/seekdb-docs` directory (official documentation)
* `.cursor/rules/seekdb.mdc` file (AI rules file)

### Dual-mode document access

The extension supports two working modes with automatic switching:

| Mode | Trigger condition | Document source | Reference format |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Remote mode (primary) | GitHub is accessible | Fetches the latest documentation from GitHub in real time | GitHub link |
| Local mode (backup) | Network timeout, error, or unreachable | Reads from the local `.cursor/rules/seekdb-docs/` directory | Local path |

#### Workflow

1. The AI assistant first tries to fetch the documentation directory from GitHub using curl.
2. If it successfully returns markdown content → Use remote mode.
3. If it times out, encounters an error, or returns empty content → Immediately switch to local mode.
4. Once switched to local mode, the assistant will no longer attempt remote access in the same conversation.

#### Version management

* Automatically detects the documentation version
* Only copies the documentation when the version updates

### One-click removal of documentation

If you no longer need seekdb documentation, you can easily remove it:

1. Open the command panel (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Enter "Remove seekdb Docs".
3. Select the Remove seekdb Docs command.

## Use cases

### Scenario 1: Quick learning of seekdb

When you're just starting with seekdb, you can directly ask questions in Cursor:

**User**: How do I create a vector index in seekdb?
**AI Assistant**: According to the seekdb documentation, you can use the following SQL to create an HNSW vector index...

### Scenario 2: Writing vector search code

While writing code, the AI assistant can provide accurate code examples based on the documentation:

**User**: Write code for hybrid search in seekdb.
**AI Assistant**:

   ```shell
   import pyseekdb

   # Connect to seekdb
   client = pyseekdb.Client(...)
   # Get the collection
   collection = client.get_collection("...")
   # Perform hybrid search
   results = collection.hybrid_search(
      query={
          "where_document": {"$contains": "..."},
          "where": {"category": {"$eq": "..."}},
          "n_results": 10
      },
      knn={
          "query_texts": ["..."],  # Will be embedded automatically
          "where": {"year": {"$gte": ...}},
          "n_results": 10
      },
      rank={"rrf": {}},  # Reciprocal Rank Fusion
      n_results=5,
      include=["documents", "metadatas", "embeddings"]
   )
   ```

### Scenario 3: Debugging and troubleshooting

When encountering issues, the AI assistant can provide solutions based on the official documentation:

**User**: My vector search is returning inaccurate results. What could be the cause?
**AI Assistant**: According to the seekdb documentation, common causes include... (provides specific troubleshooting steps and solutions)

## Summary

The seekdb Cursor Extension serves as a bridge between seekdb and the Cursor AI assistant, allowing developers to access seekdb expertise while writing code. Whether you're just starting with seekdb or developing production-level AI applications, this extension significantly enhances your development efficiency.
