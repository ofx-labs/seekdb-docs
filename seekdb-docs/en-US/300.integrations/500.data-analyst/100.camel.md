# Integrate seekdb with CamelAI

seekdb provides vector type storage, vector indexing, and embedding vector search capabilities. You can store the vectorized data in seekdb for use in subsequent searches.

CamelAI revolutionizes the way teams interact with data by allowing natural language queries to generate precise SQL queries, intelligent analysis, and visualizations.

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed seekdb.

* Your environment has a MySQL database and account with read and write permissions.

* You have installed Python 3.11 or later.

* You have installed the required dependencies.

  ```shell
  python3 -m pip install "unstructured[pdf]" camel-ai pyobvector
  ```

## Step 1: Obtain database connection information


Contact the seekdb deployment personnel or administrator to obtain the database connection string. For example:

```sql
mysql -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**Parameter description:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to seekdb.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to seekdb, which defaults to `2881`.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to access.

    :::tip

    The user must have the `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, and `SELECT` permissions on the database.

    :::


* `$user_name`: the database connection account.
* `$password`: the account password.

## Step 2: Build your AI assistant

### Set environment variables

Obtain the [Jina AI API key](https://jina.ai/api-dashboard/reader) and configure the seekdb connection information in the environment variables.

```shell
export SEEKDB_DATABASE_URL=YOUR_SEEKDB_DATABASE_URL
export SEEKDB_DATABASE_USER=YOUR_SEEKDB_DATABASE_USER
export SEEKDB_DATABASE_DB_NAME=YOUR_SEEKDB_DATABASE_DB_NAME
export SEEKDB_DATABASE_PASSWORD=YOUR_SEEKDB_DATABASE_PASSWORD
export JINAAI_API_KEY=YOUR_JINAAI_API_KEY
```

### Load data

CamelAI supports various embedding models, such as OpenAIEmbedding, VisionLanguageEmbedding, and JinaEmbedding.

```python
import os
import requests
from camel.embeddings import JinaEmbedding
from camel.storages.vectordb_storages import (
    OceanBaseStorage,
    VectorDBQuery,
    VectorRecord,
)
from camel.storages import OceanBaseStorage
from camel.retrievers import VectorRetriever
from camel.types import EmbeddingModelType

JINAAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('JINAAI_API_KEY')
embedding = JinaEmbedding(
api_key=JINAAI_API_KEY,
model_type=EmbeddingModelType.JINA_EMBEDDINGS_V3)
```

### Connect to seekdb, define the vector table structure, and store the data in seekdb

Create a table named `my_seekdb_vector_table` with a fixed structure of id, embedding, and metadata. Use the Jina AI Embeddings API to generate vectors for each text segment and store them in seekdb:

```python
OB_URI = os.getenv('SEEKDB_DATABASE_URL')
OB_USER = os.getenv('SEEKDB_DATABASE_USER')
OB_DB_NAME = os.getenv('SEEKDB_DATABASE_DB_NAME')
OB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('SEEKDB_DATABASE_PASSWORD')

# create table
ob_storage = OceanBaseStorage(
    vector_dim=embedding.get_output_dim(),
    table_name="my_seekdb_vector_table",
    uri=OB_URI,
    user=OB_USER,
    password=OB_PASSWORD,
    db_name=OB_DB_NAME,
    distance="cosine"
)

vector_retriever = VectorRetriever(
    embedding_model=embedding, storage=ob_storage
)

for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
      print(f"Processing document {i+1}/{len(documents)}")
      vector_retriever.process(content=doc)
```

### Perform semantic search

Generate a vector for the query text using the Jina AI API and search for the most relevant documents based on the cosine distance between the query vector and each vector in the vector table:

```python
retrieved_info = vector_retriever.query(query="What is generative AI?", top_k=1)
print(retrieved_info)
```

### Expected result

```python
[{'similarity score': '0.8538218656447916', 'content path': 'Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, including text,', 'metadata': {'piece_num': 1}, 'extra_info': {}, 'text': 'Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, including text, images, audio, and video. Examples include ChatGPT for text generation, DALL-E for image creation, and various AI tools for creative applications.'}]
```
