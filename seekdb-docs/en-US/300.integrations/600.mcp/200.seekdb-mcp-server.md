# seekdb MCP server

seekdb MCP server implements Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol), enabling AI assistants to interact with a seekdb database and translate **natural language** into **database operations**. You describe what you want in plain language, and the assistant can create collections, insert data, run complex queries, and even help you build a complete knowledge base workflow.

This topic introduces the capabilities and usage of seekdb MCP server. For more information about seekdb, see [seekdb database](../../400.guides/400.deploy/50.deploy-overview.md).

## Architecture and features

### Core capabilities

seekdb MCP server exposes database tools directly to AI assistants.

| Category | Tools | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vector collection management | `create_collection`, `query_collection`, `add_data_to_collection`, etc. | Create vector collections, run semantic search, and manage documents |
| Advanced search | `full_text_search`, `hybrid_search` | Full-text search and hybrid search (BM25 + vectors) |
| AI functions | `ai_complete`, `ai_rerank`, `create_ai_model`, etc. | Call LLMs for text generation and rerank search results |
| AI memory system | `seekdb_memory_query`, `seekdb_memory_insert`, etc. | Persistent memory across sessions so the assistant can "remember" you |
| Data import/export | `import_csv_file_to_seekdb`, `export_csv_file_from_seekdb` | Convert CSV files to and from database tables / vector collections |

## Installation and configuration

### Install the seekdb database

Before you use seekdb MCP Server, you need a running seekdb database. seekdb supports two deployment modes. For details, see [Deploy seekdb](../../400.guides/400.deploy/50.deploy-overview.md).

- Embedded mode (zero configuration; Linux only)

    If you use embedded mode, you do not need to install seekdb separately. When you start seekdb MCP server, it initializes a local embedded database automatically.

    This is suitable for: personal learning, rapid prototyping, and edge devices.

        :::tip
        Embedded mode is currently supported on Linux only. If you are on macOS or Windows, use seekdb client/server mode and deploy seekdb first (Docker is recommended).
        :::

- Client/server mode (recommended for production)

    For details, see [Deploy seekdb using yum install](../../400.guides/400.deploy/700.server-mode/100.deploy-by-systemd.md) and [Deploy seekdb in a container environment](../../400.guides/400.deploy/700.server-mode/200.deploy-by-docker.md).

### Install seekdb MCP server

#### Install uv

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Configure your AI tool

##### Stdio transport

Using Cursor as an example: open **Settings** → **Tools & MCP** → **New MCP Server**, then choose the configuration based on your OS.

- Linux (embedded mode):

    ```json
    {
    "mcpServers": {
        "seekdb": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["seekdb-mcp-server"]
        }
    }
    }
    ```

    When the server starts, it automatically initializes a local embedded seekdb database.

- macOS / Windows (client/server mode):

    macOS and Windows do not support embedded mode. Deploy seekdb first (Docker is recommended), then configure the connection parameters:

    ```json
    {
    "mcpServers": {
        "seekdb": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["seekdb-mcp-server"],
        "env": {
            "SEEKDB_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
            "SEEKDB_PORT": "2881",
            "SEEKDB_USER": "root",
            "SEEKDB_PASSWORD": "",
            "SEEKDB_DATABASE": "test"
        }
        }
    }
    }
    ```

    Parameter reference:

    | Parameter | Description | Default |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `SEEKDB_HOST` | seekdb server host | `127.0.0.1` |
    | `SEEKDB_PORT` | seekdb server port | `2881` |
    | `SEEKDB_USER` | Database username | `root` |
    | `SEEKDB_PASSWORD` | Database password | (empty) |
    | `SEEKDB_DATABASE` | Database name | `test` |

##### SSE transport

- Linux (embedded mode)

    Start the SSE server:

    ```shell
    uvx seekdb-mcp-server --transport sse --port 6000
    ```

- macOS / Windows (client/server mode)

    1. Configure environment variables, then start the server:

        ```shell
        export SEEKDB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        export SEEKDB_PORT=2881
        export SEEKDB_USER=root
        export SEEKDB_PASSWORD=
        export SEEKDB_DATABASE=test
        ```

    2. Start the SSE server:

        ```shell
        uvx seekdb-mcp-server --transport sse --port 6000
        ```

    3. Configure the client:

        ```json
        {
        "sse-seekdb": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:6000/sse"
        }
        }
        ```

## Application scenarios

seekdb MCP server is suitable for a wide range of use cases.

### Build a knowledge base

Store documents, notes, and code snippets in a vector collection and find relevant content with semantic search:

```shell
"Add this article about React Hooks to the knowledge base"
"Search for previously saved notes on state management"
```

### Prototype a RAG app

Validate ideas for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) applications without building a complex backend:

```shell
"Create a collection of product documents and import them"
"Answer user questions based on these documents"
```

### Data analysis

Import CSV data and analyze it using natural language:

```shell
"Import this sales data CSV file"
"Analyze last month's sales trends"
```

### Enhance AI coding assistants

Give AI coding assistants persistent memory:

```shell
"Remember: This project uses PostgreSQL as the primary database"
"Remember: I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"
```
