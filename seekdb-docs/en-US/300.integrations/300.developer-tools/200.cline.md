# Integrate seekdb MCP Server with Cline

seekdb provides capabilities for storing vector data, building vector indexes, and performing embedding vector searches. You can store vectorized data in seekdb for subsequent searches.

[Cline](https://cline.bot/) is an open-source AI coding assistant that supports the MCP protocol.

This topic demonstrates how to quickly build a backend application using seekdb MCP Server and Cline.

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed the seekdb database.

* Install [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the corresponding [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). If your machine has a low Python version, you can use Miniconda to create a new Python 3.11 or later environment. For more information, see [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).

* Install the Python package manager uv. After the installation is complete, run the `uv --version` command to verify whether the installation is successful:

    ```shell
    pip install uv
    uv --version
    ```

* Install Cline:

  * If you use the Visual Studio Code IDE, search for and install the Cline plugin in the **Extensions** section. The plugin name is `Cline`.

  * If you do not use an IDE, refer to the [Cline installation guide](https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/installing-cline) and download Cline from [Cline](https://cline.bot/).

## Step 1: Obtain the database connection information

Contact the seekdb database deployment personnel or administrator to obtain the corresponding database connection string, for example:

```shell
mysql -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**Parameter description:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to seekdb.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to seekdb. The default value is `2881`.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

    :::tip
    The user for the connection must have the `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, and `SELECT` permissions on the database.
    :::

* `$user_name`: the database connection account.
* `$password`: the account password.

## Step 2: Configure seekdb MCP Server

This example uses Visual Studio Code to show how to configure seekdb MCP Server.

### Install seekdb MCP Server

Run the following command to install seekdb MCP Server:

```shell
pip install seekdb-mcp-server
```

### Configure the seekdb server environment variables in the .env file

Create a file named `.env` in the current directory and add the following content:

```shell
vi .env

SEEKDB_HOST=localhost      # Database host
SEEKDB_PORT=2881           # Database port (default: 2881)
SEEKDB_USER=your_username
SEEKDB_PASSWORD=your_password
SEEKDB_DATABASE=your_database
```

### Start in SSE mode

```shell
env $(cat .env | xargs) uvx seekdb-mcp-server --transport sse --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Create a Visual Studio Code workspace

Manually create a Visual Studio Code workspace on your local device and open it with Visual Studio Code. The files generated by Cline will be stored in this directory. The example directory name is `cline-generate`.

#### Configure the large model

Click the `Cline icon` in the sidebar to open the Cline dialog box and configure a large model for Cline:

#### Configure seekdb MCP Server

1. Click the `MCP Servers icon` in the following figure.

    ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/cline/3.png)

2. Fill in the configuration file and click OK.

    ```sehll
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sse-seekdb": {
          "autoApprove": [],
          "disabled": false,
          "timeout": 60,
          "type": "sse",
          "url": "http://ip:port/sse"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. If the configuration is successful, the status will show as `Available`, and the `MCP tools` and `resources` information will be displayed, as shown below:

    ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/cline/4.png)

#### Test the MCP Server

Open the Cline session box as shown below, and enter the prompt `How many tables in the test database?`. Cline will display the SQL statement to be executed. If there are no issues, click `Approve`. Cline will display the names of the tables in the current test database, indicating that it can connect to seekdb.

### Use FastAPI to quickly create a RESTful API project

You can use FastAPI to quickly create a RESTful API project. FastAPI is a Python web framework that allows you to build RESTful APIs quickly.

1. Create a customer table

    Enter the prompt: `Create a "customer" table with "ID" as the primary key and containing fields such as "name", "age", "telephone", and "location"` in the dialog box. Confirm the SQL statement and click the `Approve` button to execute it.

    ![6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/cline/6.png)

2. Insert test data

    Enter the prompt: `Insert 10 pieces of data into the customer table` in the dialog box. Confirm the SQL statement and click the `Approve` button to execute it.

    ![7](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/cline/7.png)

3. Create a FastAPI project

    Enter the prompt: `Create a FastAPI project on the customer table` in the dialog box and click the `Approve` button to execute it.

    ![8](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/cline/8.png)

    This step will automatically generate multiple files. It is recommended to select "Accept All" for the first use, as the content of the AI-generated files may be uncertain. You can adjust them as needed based on your actual requirements later.

4. Configure the database connection information for the FastAPI project

    ![9](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/cline/9.png)

5. Install the project dependencies

    Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Start the FastAPI project

    Run the following command to start the FastAPI project:

    ```shell
    source .env
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

7. View the data in the table

    Run the following command in the command line or use other request tools to view the data in the table:

    ```shell
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers
    ```

    The returned result is as follows:

    ```json
    [{"name":"John Smith","age":35,"telephone":"13800138001","location":"New York","id":1},{"name":"Sarah Johnson","age":28,"telephone":"13800138002","location":"Los Angeles","id":2},{"name":"Michael Brown","age":42,"telephone":"13800138003","location":"Chicago","id":3},{"name":"Emily Davis","age":31,"telephone":"13800138004","location":"Houston","id":4},{"name":"David Wilson","age":39,"telephone":"13800138005","location":"Phoenix","id":5},{"name":"Lisa Miller","age":26,"telephone":"13800138006","location":"Philadelphia","id":6},{"name":"James Taylor","age":45,"telephone":"13800138007","location":"San Antonio","id":7},{"name":"Jennifer Anderson","age":33,"telephone":"13800138008","location":"San Diego","id":8},{"name":"Robert Thomas","age":37,"telephone":"13800138009","location":"Dallas","id":9},{"name":"Mary Jackson","age":29,"telephone":"13800138010","location":"San Jose","id":10}]
