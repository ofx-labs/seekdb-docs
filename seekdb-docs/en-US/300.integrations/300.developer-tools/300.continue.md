# Integrate seekdb MCP Server with Continue

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open-source protocol released by Anthropic in November 2024. It enables large language models to interact with external tools or data sources. With MCP, users do not need to manually copy and execute the output of large models; instead, the models can directly instruct tools to perform specific actions (Actions).

[MCP Server](https://github.com/oceanbase/awesome-oceanbase-mcp/tree/main/src/seekdb_mcp_server) provides the capability for large models to interact with seekdb through the MCP protocol, allowing the execution of SQL statements. With the right client, you can quickly build a project prototype, and it is open-source on GitHub.

[Continue](https://continue.dev) is an IDE extension that integrates with the MCP Server, supporting Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA.

This topic will guide you on how to integrate Continue with the seekdb MCP Server to quickly build backend applications.

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed seekdb.

* You have installed [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the corresponding [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). If your machine has a low Python version, you can use Miniconda to create a new Python 3.11 or later environment. For more information, see [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).

* Install uv, a Python package manager. After the installation, run the `uv --version` command to verify the installation:

    ```shell
    pip install uv
    uv --version
    ```

* Install the Continue extension in Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA. The extension name is `Continue`.

## Step 1: Obtain the database connection information

Contact your seekdb deployment engineer or administrator to obtain the database connection string. For example:

```sql
mysql -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**Parameters:**

* `$host`: The IP address for connecting to seekdb.
* `$port`: The port number for connecting to seekdb. Default is `2881`.
* `$database_name`: The name of the database to access.

    :::tip
    The connected user must have `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, and `SELECT` privileges on the database.
    :::

* `$user_name`: The username for connecting to the database.
* `$password`: The password for the account.

## Step 2: Configure the seekdb MCP Server

This section uses Visual Studio Code as an example to show how to configure the seekdb MCP Server.

### Install the seekdb MCP Server

Run the following command to install the seekdb MCP Server:

```shell
pip install seekdb-mcp-server
```

### Configure the seekdb server environment variables in the .env file

Create a file named `.env` in the current directory and add the following content:

```shell
vi .env

SEEKDB_HOST=localhost      # Database host
SEEKDB_PORT=2881           # Database port (default: 2881)
SEEKDB_USER=your_username
SEEKDB_PASSWORD=your_password
SEEKDB_DATABASE=your_database
```

### Start in SSE mode

```shell
env $(cat .env | xargs) uvx seekdb-mcp-server --transport sse --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Configure the large model and seekdb MCP Server in the Continue plugin

Manually create a Visual Studio Code workspace directory and open it with Visual Studio Code. The files generated by Continue will be placed in this directory. The example directory is named `Continue`.

#### Configure the large model

Click the `Continue icon` in the sidebar to open the `Continue` dialog box. Click Settings to go to `Add Models` and configure the large model for Continue:

![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/continue/2.png)

The `config.yaml` file for configuring the large model is as follows:

```shell
name: Local Config
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1
models:
  - name: Qwen Plus
    provider: openai
    model: qwen-plus
    apiKey: ***********
    apiBase: "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
```

#### Configure the seekdb MCP Server

MCP can be used only in the Continue Agent and Plan modes.

![](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/continue/3.png)

The `config.yaml` file for configuring the seekdb MCP Servers is as follows:

```shell
mcpServers:
  - name: sse-seekdb
    type: sse
    url: "http://ip:port/sse"
    timeout: 60
    autoApprove: []
    disabled: false
```

#### Test the MCP Server

Open the Continue session dialog box and enter the prompt `How many tables in the test database?`. Continue will display the SQL statement to be executed. If there are no issues, click `Accept`. Continue will display the names of the tables in the test database, indicating that it can connect to seekdb.

### Use FastAPI to quickly create a RESTful API project

You can use FastAPI to quickly create a RESTful API project. FastAPI is a Python web framework that allows you to build RESTful APIs quickly.

1. Create a customer table

    Enter the prompt: `Create a "customer" table with "ID" as the primary key and containing fields such as "name", "age", "telephone", and "location"` in the dialog box. Confirm the SQL statement and click the `Accept` button to execute it.

    ![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/continue/5.png)

2. Insert test data

    Enter the prompt: `Insert 10 pieces of data into the customer table` in the dialog box. Confirm the SQL statement and click the Accept button to execute it:

    ![6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/continue/6.png)

3. Create a FastAPI project

    Enter the prompt: `Create a FastAPI project on the customer table` in the dialog box. Click the Accept button to execute it.

    ![7](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/continue/7.png)

    This step will automatically generate multiple files. It is recommended to select `All Accept` for the first use, as the content of the files generated by AI may be uncertain. You can adjust them as needed based on your actual requirements.

4. Configure the database connection information for the FastAPI project

    ![8](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/continue/8.png)

5. Install the project dependencies

    Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Start the FastAPI project

    Run the following command to start the FastAPI project:

    ```shell
    source .env
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

7. View the data in the table

    Run the following command in the command line or use other request tools to view the data in the table:

    ```shell
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers
    ```

    The returned result is as follows:

    ```json
    [{"id":null,"name":"John Smith","age":35,"telephone":"138-0000-0001","location":"New York"},{"id":null,"name":"Emma Johnson","age":28,"telephone":"138-0000-0002","location":"Los Angeles"},{"id":null,"name":"Michael Brown","age":42,"telephone":"138-0000-0003","location":"Chicago"},{"id":null,"name":"Sophia Davis","age":31,"telephone":"138-0000-0004","location":"Houston"},{"id":null,"name":"William Wilson","age":45,"telephone":"138-0000-0005","location":"Phoenix"},{"id":null,"name":"Olivia Moore","age":29,"telephone":"138-0000-0006","location":"Philadelphia"},{"id":null,"name":"James Taylor","age":38,"telephone":"138-0000-0007","location":"San Antonio"},{"id":null,"name":"Ava Anderson","age":33,"telephone":"138-0000-0008","location":"San Diego"},{"id":null,"name":"Alexander Thomas","age":41,"telephone":"138-0000-0009","location":"Dallas"},{"id":null,"name":"Isabella Jackson","age":36,"telephone":"138-0000-0010","location":"San Jose"}]
    ```
