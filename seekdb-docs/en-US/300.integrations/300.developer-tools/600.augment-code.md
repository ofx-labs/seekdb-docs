# Integrate seekdb MCP Server with Augment Code

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open-source protocol released by Anthropic in November 2024, designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools or data sources. With MCP, users no longer need to manually copy and execute the output of the large model. Instead, the large model can directly command the tool to perform the corresponding action (Action).

[MCP Server](https://github.com/oceanbase/awesome-oceanbase-mcp/tree/main/src/seekdb_mcp_server) provides the capability for large models to interact with seekdb through the MCP protocol and execute SQL statements. With the right client, you can quickly build a project prototype, and it is already open-sourced on GitHub.

[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) is a developer AI platform that helps you understand your code, debug issues, and release faster by understanding your codebase. Use chat, next-step editing, and code completion to get more done.

This article will demonstrate how to use Augment Code to quickly build a backend application using seekdb MCP Server.

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed seekdb.

* You have installed [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the corresponding [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). If your machine has a lower Python version, you can use Miniconda to create a new Python 3.11 or later environment. For more information, see the [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).

* You have installed the Python package manager uv. After installation, you can use the `uv --version` command to verify the installation:

    ```shell
    pip install uv
    uv --version
    ```

* You have installed the `Augment Code` plugin in Visual Studio Code.

## Step 1: Obtain Database Connection Information

Contact the seekdb deployment personnel or administrator to obtain the corresponding database connection string, for example:

```sql
mysql -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**Parameter Description:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to seekdb.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to seekdb, default is 2881.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

    :::tip

    The user needs to have the `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, and `SELECT` permissions on the database.

    :::

* `$user_name`: the database connection account.
* `$password`: the account password.

## Step 2: Configure seekdb MCP Server

This example uses Visual Studio Code to demonstrate how to configure seekdb MCP Server.

### Install seekdb MCP Server

Run the following command to install:

```shell
pip install seekdb-mcp-server
```

### Configure seekdb Server Environment Variables in the .env File

Create a file named `.env` in the current directory and add the following content:

```shell
vi .env

SEEKDB_HOST=localhost      # Database host
SEEKDB_PORT=2881           # Database port (default: 2881)
SEEKDB_USER=your_username
SEEKDB_PASSWORD=your_password
SEEKDB_DATABASE=your_database
```

### Start in SSE Mode

```shell
env $(cat .env | xargs) uvx seekdb-mcp-server --transport sse --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Add and Configure MCP Servers

1. Log in to Augment Code.

2. Configure seekdb MCP Server in Augment Code.

   ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/augment-code/3.png)

3. Click Import from json and fill in the MCP configuration file.

   ![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/augment-code/5.png)

4. Fill in the configuration file and click Confirm.

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "seekdb": {
         "autoApprove": [],
         "disabled": false,
         "timeout": 60,
         "type": "sse",
         "url": "http://ip:port/sse"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Augment Code displays the tools in the current seekdb MCP server, indicating that the configuration is successful.
