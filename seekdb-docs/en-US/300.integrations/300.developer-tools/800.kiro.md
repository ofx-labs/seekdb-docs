# Integrate seekdb MCP Server with Kiro

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open-source protocol launched by Anthropic in November 2024. It enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools or data sources. With MCP, users can directly instruct tools to execute actions based on the LLM's output, eliminating the need for manual copying and pasting.

[seekdb MCP Server](https://github.com/oceanbase/awesome-oceanbase-mcp/tree/main/src/seekdb_mcp_server) is a server that allows large models to interact with seekdb through the MCP protocol. It can execute SQL statements. With the help of a suitable client, you can quickly build a project prototype, and it has been open-sourced on GitHub.

[Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for AI agents, launched by AWS. It is a programming tool with AI capabilities, aimed at helping developers complete the entire development process from concept to production deployment.

This topic demonstrates how to use Kiro to quickly build a backend application with seekdb MCP Server.

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed seekdb.

* You have installed [Python 3.11 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the corresponding [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). If your machine has a lower Python version, you can use Miniconda to create a new Python 3.11 or later environment. For more information, see [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).

* You have installed the Python package manager uv. After the installation is complete, you can run the `uv --version` command to verify whether the installation is successful:

   ```shell
   pip install uv
   uv --version
   ```

* Kiro client:

  You can download the appropriate version of Kiro based on your operating system from the [kiro download page](https://kiro.dev/downloads/).

## Step 1: Obtain database connection information

Contact the seekdb deployment personnel or administrator to obtain the corresponding database connection string, for example:

```sql
mysql -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**Parameter description:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to seekdb.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to seekdb. The default value is 2881.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

    :::tip

    The user for the connection must have the `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`, and `SELECT` permissions on the database.

    :::

* `$user_name`: the database connection account.
* `$password`: the account password.

## Step 2: Configure seekdb MCP Server

Here, we use Visual Studio Code as an example to show how to configure seekdb MCP Server.

### Install seekdb MCP Server

Run the following command to install seekdb MCP Server:

```shell
pip install seekdb-mcp-server
```

### Configure seekdb server environment variables in the .env file

Create a file named `.env` in the current directory and add the following content:

```shell
vi .env

SEEKDB_HOST=localhost      # Database host
SEEKDB_PORT=2881           # Database port (default: 2881)
SEEKDB_USER=your_username
SEEKDB_PASSWORD=your_password
SEEKDB_DATABASE=your_database
```

### Start in SSE mode

```shell
env $(cat .env | xargs) uvx seekdb-mcp-server --transport sse --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Configure seekdb MCP Server in Kiro

1. Press the Command + L shortcut key (on macOS) to open the chat dialog box, click the gear icon in the lower-left corner, and select Kiro Settings.

2. Click Open User MCP Config (JSON)/Open Workspace MCP Config (JSON) to fill in the mcp configuration file.

   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/2.png)

   ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/3.png)

   Fill in the following configuration file and click Confirm.

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "seekdb": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["seekdb-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
           "SEEKDB_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
           "SEEKDB_PORT": "2881",
           "SEEKDB_USER": "root",
           "SEEKDB_PASSWORD": "",
           "SEEKDB_DATABASE": "test"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Verify whether you can connect to the database.

   Enter the prompt `How many tables in the test database?`. Kiro will display the SQL statement to be executed and output the query result:

   ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/4.png)

   Kiro will display the number of tables in the test database, indicating that you can normally connect to seekdb.

## Step 3: Use FastAPI to quickly create a RESTful API project

You can use FastAPI to quickly create a RESTful API project. FastAPI is a Python web framework that allows you to build RESTful APIs quickly.

1. Create a customer table

    Enter the prompt `Create a "customer" table with "ID" as the primary key and containing fields such as "name", "age", "telephone", and "location"`:

    ![5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/5.png )

2. Insert test data

    Enter the prompt `Insert 10 pieces of data into the customer table`:

    ![6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/6.png)

3. Create a FastAPI project

    Enter the prompt `Create a FastAPI project on the customer table`. Multiple files will be automatically generated. Click Accept All to accept them. You can make secondary modifications if there are any issues. Since the AI-generated files may vary each time, we will not show the modification process here.

    ![7](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/7.png)

    This step will automatically generate multiple files. We recommend that you select `Accept All` for the first time, as the content of AI-generated files may be uncertain. You can adjust them as needed later.

4. Configure the database connection information for the FastAPI project

    ![8](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/SeekDB/integrations/developer-tools/kiro/8.png)

5. Install project dependencies

    Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Start the FastAPI project

    Run the following command to start the FastAPI project:

    ```shell
    source .env
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

7. View the data in the table

    Run the following command in the command line or use other request tools to view the data in the table:

    ```shell
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/customers
    ```

    The returned result is as follows:

    ```json
    [{"name":"John Smith","age":28,"telephone":"555-0123","location":"New York, NY","ID":1},{"name":"Sarah Johnson","age":34,"telephone":"555-0456","location":"Los Angeles, CA","ID":2},{"name":"Michael Brown","age":42,"telephone":"555-0789","location":"Chicago, IL","ID":3},{"name":"Emily Davis","age":29,"telephone":"555-0321","location":"Houston, TX","ID":4},{"name":"David Wilson","age":37,"telephone":"555-0654","location":"Phoenix, AZ","ID":5},{"name":"Lisa Anderson","age":31,"telephone":"555-0987","location":"Philadelphia, PA","ID":6},{"name":"Robert Taylor","age":45,"telephone":"555-0147","location":"San Antonio, TX","ID":7},{"name":"Jennifer Martinez","age":26,"telephone":"555-0258","location":"San Diego, CA","ID":8},{"name":"Christopher Lee","age":39,"telephone":"555-0369","location":"Dallas, TX","ID":9},{"name":"Amanda White","age":33,"telephone":"555-0741","location":"San Jose, CA","ID":10}]
