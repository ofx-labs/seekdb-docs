* seekdb error code: 10503

* Cause: The specified column type does not support the TTL option.

* Solution: Confirm whether the specified column type is supported for TTL definitions.

## ERROR 10504 (HY000) : TTL command is not allowed, current TTL status is '%s'

* seekdb error: 10504

* Cause: The TTL command cannot be executed because the current TTL is in a specific state.

* Solution: Check whether the current state is as expected, and change the state by using an appropriate TTL command.

## ERROR 10505 (HY000) : No TTL task is running, please try trigger a new TTL task

* seekdb error code:10505

* Error reason: The running TTL task is not found. You need to try to trigger a new TTL task.

## ERROR 10507 (HY000) : Time to live of hbase table must be greater than 0

* seekdb error code: 10507

* Reason: The TTL of an HBase table must be greater than 0.

* Solution: Check the `KV_ATTRIBUTES` attribute of the current table and ensure that the defined TimeToLive value is greater than 0.

## ERROR 10508 (HY000) : MaxVersions of hbase table must be greater than 0

* seekdb error code:10508

* Error reason: The MaxVersions parameter of the HBase table must be greater than 0.

## ERROR 10510 (HY000) : Rowkey column count not match, schema rowkey count is '%ld', input rowkey count is '%ld'

* seekdb Error Code: 10510

* Cause: The number of row keys in the input row key column does not match the number of row keys in the database table during execution of the operation.

* Solution: Make sure that the number of row keys provided during the operation matches the row key columns of the table.

## ERROR 10511 (HY000) : Column type for '%.*s' not match, schema column type is '%.*s', input column type is '%.*s'

* seekdb error code: 10511

* Cause: The column data type of the input data does not match the data type of the column in the database table. This may cause data conversion errors or prevent operations from being performed correctly.

* Solution: Ensure that the data types of the input columns match those of the table columns during the operation.

## ERROR 10512 (HY000) : Collation type for '%.*s' not match, schema collation type is '%.*s', input collation type is '%.*s'

* seekdb error: 10512

* Cause: The character set types are not matched.

* Solution: Ensure that the character set type used in the operation matches the character set type of the table.

## ERROR 10513 (HY000) : Scan range missing, input scan range cell count is '%ld', which should equal to rowkey count '%ld'

* seekdb error code: 10513

* The reason for the error: The number of columns in the scanning scope does not match the number of table primary key columns during a scanning operation.

* Resolution: Make sure that the number of columns in the scanned ranges is the same as the number of primary key columns.

## ERROR 10515 (HY000) : Redis protocol parse error, the input redis string is: '%.*s'

* seekdb Error Code: 10515

* Error: Error in parsing Redis protocol.

* Fix: The client may have sent a custom Redis command that is not supported by the seekdb database, or the command may be improperly formatted.

## ERROR 10518 (HY000) : Check failed in %.*s"

* seekdb error code: 10518

* Cause: The OBKV [checkAndInsertUp interface](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000002025908) has the rollbackWhenCheckFailed parameter set to `true`. When a check fails, this error is thrown.

* Resolution: Throw the error to indicate that the verification failed. Depending on your specific business needs, you can choose to ignore this error or handle it in some other way.

## ERROR 10519 (HY000) : '%.*s' is not disabled

* seekdb error code: 10519

* The cause: The state of the table is not DISABLED, so you cannot call the `enableTable()` or `deleteTable()` method of the HBase Admin API.

* Solution: Call the `disableTable()` method of HBase Admin to set the status of the table to DISABLED, and then try again.

## ERROR 10520 (HY000) : '%.*s' is not enabled

* seekdb error code:10520

* The table is not in the ENABLED state, and therefore cannot be accessed.

* Solution: Call the `enableTable()` method of the HBase Admin API to set the table status to ENABLED, and then retry.

## ERROR 10521 (HY000) : namespace '%.*s' is not found

* seekdb error code: 10521

* Error: The specified HBase tablespace does not exist.

* Solution: create a corresponding HBase table space in the OBKV-HBase database and retry.

## ERROR 10522 (HY000) : table '%.*s' already exists

* seekdb error code: 10522

* Error reason: The specified HBase table already exists.

* Solution: Verify whether the existing table meets the requirements. If not, delete the existing table and then create the required HBase table.

## ERROR 10523 (HY000) : table '%.*s' not found

* seekdb error code: 10523

* Error reason: The specified HBase table does not exist.

* Solution: Create the corresponding HBase table.

## ERROR 11081 (HY000) : skip_header and parse_header cannot be used at the same time

* seekdb error code: 11081

* Error reason: `PARSE_HEADER` and `SKIP_HEADER` cannot be used at the same time, as they conflict in semantics.

* Solution: When specifying external file format-related properties, do not use both `PARSE_HEADER` and `SKIP_HEADER` parameters.

## ERROR 11082 (HY000) : DDL operations on the internal catalog are not allowed

* seekdb error code: 11082

* Error reason: DDL operations on the internal catalog are not allowed.

* Solution: Check the type of the catalog to be operated on.

## ERROR 11083 (HY000) : Command denied to user '%.*s'@'%.*s' for catalog '%.*s'

* seekdb error code: 11083

* Error reason: The user does not have the required permissions for the catalog.

* Solution: Check whether the user has the required permissions for the catalog and grant the user the required permissions for the catalog.

## ERROR 11088 (HY000) : reject limit %ld reached

* seekdb error code: 11088

* Error reason: The rejection limit %ld has been reached.

* Solution: Check the diagnostic error limit information.

## ERROR 11094 (HY000) : Sensitive rule '%.*s' exists

* seekdb error code: 11094

* Error reason: A sensitive rule with the same name already exists. This typically occurs when a DDL statement attempts to add a sensitive rule with the same name as an existing one.

* Solution: Delete the existing sensitive rule and then retry.

## ERROR 11095 (HY000) : Sensitive rule '%.*s' does not exist

* seekdb error code: 11095

* Error reason: The specified sensitive rule does not exist. This typically occurs when a DDL statement attempts to delete a non-existent sensitive rule.

* Solution: Check whether the sensitive rule exists and then retry.

## ERROR 11096 (HY000) : Sensitive column %.*s(%.*s) exists

* seekdb error code: 11096

* Error reason: The specified column is already a sensitive column. This typically occurs when a DDL statement attempts to apply a sensitive rule to a column that is already covered by another sensitive rule.

* Solution: Check whether the column is already covered by another sensitive rule. If so, remove the existing sensitive rule or select an uncovered column to apply the new sensitive rule.

## ERROR 11097 (HY000) : Sensitive column %.*s(%.*s) does not exist

* seekdb error code: 11097

* Error reason: The specified sensitive column does not exist. This typically occurs when a DDL statement attempts to remove a column that is not a sensitive column.

* Solution: Confirm whether the column to be removed is indeed a sensitive column. Check the sensitive rule configuration to ensure that the specified column name and table name are correct.

## ERROR 11098 (HY000) : Access sensitive field protected by sensitive rule '%.*s' denied to user '%.*s'@'%.*s

* seekdb error code: 11098

* Error reason: The user does not have the required permissions to access the sensitive field protected by the specified sensitive rule.

* Solution: Contact the database administrator to grant the current user the required permissions to access the sensitive rule, or use a user account with the required permissions.

## ERROR 11099 (HY000) : Invalid sensitive rule name '%.*s'

* seekdb error code: 11099

* Error reason: The specified sensitive rule name is invalid.

* Solution: Check whether the sensitive rule name complies with the naming conventions. Ensure that the name does not contain special characters, is within the allowed length, and does not conflict with existing rule names.
