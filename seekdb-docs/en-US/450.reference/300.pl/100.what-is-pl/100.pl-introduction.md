# PL overview

PL is a procedural language (Procedural Language, PL). It is an extension of SQL, adding programming language features to standard SQL statements. It organizes data operations and query statements within PL code, enabling complex functionality through logical judgments, loops, and other operations.

Using PL, you can create programs with advanced features. It allows you to encapsulate business logic within the database, providing better abstraction and security. It also reduces network interactions, resulting in faster call speeds and improved overall performance.

The main advantages of PL are as follows:

* High performance

  When interacting with the database using PL, all processing logic is handled on the database server, and only the required results are returned to the client. This significantly reduces data exchange between the application server and the database server, saving network resources and processing time.

  PL objects are stored in the database in a precompiled form. Compared to standard SQL, the optimizer provides better optimization for PL, resulting in more efficient execution.

* Easy development

  Many features of PL can help developers save time on development design and error troubleshooting.

* Portability

  For database developers, PL is a portable standard language. PL applications can run in any seekdb.

* Easy management

  PL objects are stored in the database. When making application modifications or version iterations, simply updating the database PL objects ensures that all applications take effect immediately, eliminating concerns about differences in client code updates.
