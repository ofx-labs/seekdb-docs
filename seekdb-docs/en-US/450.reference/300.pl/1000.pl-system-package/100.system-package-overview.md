# Overview

seekdb supports PL system packages to extend database functionality and provide access to SQL features through PL.

You can use the provided system packages when creating applications or your own stored procedures. This manual describes the system packages supported by seekdb.

System packages are encapsulated collections of related program objects stored in the database. Program objects include stored procedures, functions, variables, constants, cursors, and exceptions.

After you have the required privileges, run the following statement in the `oceanbase` schema to query the system packages supported by seekdb and their related information:

```sql
USE oceanbase;
SELECT * FROM __all_package;
```

## Components of a PL system package

A PL system package consists of two parts: the package specification (`SPECIFICATION`) and the package body (`BODY`). The package specification serves as the application interface, containing public declarations visible to the application. These declarations include types, variables, constants, exceptions, cursors, and subprograms that can be used. The package body contains implementation details and private declarations hidden from the application. It fully defines cursors and subprograms to support the implementation of the package specification.

  :::info

  seekdb does not support user modification of system packages.

## Using PL system packages

When you create a database, the system packages provided by seekdb are automatically installed.

## Overview of PL system packages

The following table lists the PL system packages supported by seekdb and their brief descriptions.

|                      System package                      |            Description                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| [DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER](13300.dbms-resource-manager/100.dbms-resource-manager-overview.md)|  Used to maintain resource usage plans, resource usage groups, and resource plan directives.|
| [DBMS_STATS](15900.dbms-stats/100.dbms-stats-overview.md)        | View and modify the statistics collected by the optimizer for database objects.                        |
| [DBMS_UDR](17800.dbms-udr/100.dbms-udr-overview.md)| Provides a rewrite binding feature, allowing SQL statements received by the database to be rewritten based on matching rules before SQL execution begins.|
| [DBMS_VECTOR](17850.dbms-vector/100.dbms-vector-overview.md)| Used to manage vector indexes.|
| [DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY](17900.dbms-workload-repository/100.dbms-workload-repository-overview.md)|  Used to manage the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR). |
| [DBMS_MVIEW](9950.dbms-mview/100.dbms-mview-overview.md)  | Allows callers to understand the functionality of materialized views and potential materialized views, including their query rewrite availability. Refreshes materialized views not in the same refresh group and clears logs.    |
| [DBMS_MVIEW_STAT](10050.dbms-mview-stat/100.dbms-mview-stat-overview.md)  | Allows callers to use interfaces to manage the collection and retention of statistics for materialized view refresh operations.    |
| [DBMS_PARTITION](13200.dbms_partition/100.dbms_partition-overview.md)|  Used to provide dynamic partition management interfaces.|
