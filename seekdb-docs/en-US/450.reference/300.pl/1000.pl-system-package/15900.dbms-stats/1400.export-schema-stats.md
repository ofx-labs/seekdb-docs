# EXPORT_SCHEMA_STATS

The `EXPORT_SCHEMA_STATS` procedure is used to export statistics for all tables in a schema.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_STATS.EXPORT_SCHEMA_STATS (
  ownname         VARCHAR2,
  stattab         VARCHAR2,
  statown         VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL);
```

## Parameters

|   Parameter    |         Description          |
|---------|---------------------|
| ownname | The name of the schema.          |
| stattab | The name of the user table where the statistics are stored.     |
| statown | The name of the user who owns the user table where the statistics are stored.   |

## Exceptions

The error code `HY000` indicates that the object does not exist or the user does not have sufficient privileges.

## Usage notes

* To call this procedure, you must be the owner of the table.

* Statistics cannot be exported or imported between databases with different character sets.

## Examples

Export statistics for all tables in the `hr` schema owned by the user `testUser01` to the `test_stat` table.

```sql
CALL DBMS_STATS.EXPORT_SCHEMA_STATS('hr', stattab=>'test_stat', statown=>'testUser01');
Query OK, 0 rows affected
