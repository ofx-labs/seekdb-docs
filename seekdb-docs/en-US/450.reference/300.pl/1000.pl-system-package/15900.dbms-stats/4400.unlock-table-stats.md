# UNLOCK_TABLE_STATS

The `UNLOCK_TABLE_STATS` procedure is used to unlock table-level statistics.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_STATS.UNLOCK_TABLE_STATS (
  ownname    VARCHAR2,
  tabname    VARCHAR2,
  stattype   VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'ALL');
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|-----------------------|
| ownname  | The username. If `ownname` is set to `NULL`, the current login username is used.   |
| tabname  | The table name.     |
| stattype | The type of lock. The following three lock types are generally supported: <ul><li> `'ALL'` </li>  <li> `'DATA'`   </li>  <li> `'CACHE'` </li>  </ul>   |

## Usage notes

* You must be the owner of the table to call this procedure.

* When the statistics of a table are locked, the statistics of all dependent objects, including table-level statistics, column-level statistics, histogram statistics, and statistics of all dependent indexes, are also locked.

* If the statistics of an object are locked, an error is returned when you execute the `SET_*`, `DELETE_*`, `IMPORT_*`, or `GATHER_*` procedure to modify the statistics of a single table, index, or column.

* The `UNLOCK_SCHEMA_STATS` and `UNLOCK_TABLE_STATS` procedures cannot unlock the statistics of corresponding partitions. When you call the `LOCK_TABLE_STATS` procedure, it sets the lock at the table level. At this point, you cannot collect statistics for dependent objects such as partitions and indexes. Additionally, if the table statistics are locked, the dependent objects are also locked, so you do not need to explicitly call the `LOCK_PARTITION_STATS` stored procedure to lock the partition statistics.

## Examples

Unlock the table-level statistics of the `t1` table in the `test` user.

```sql
CALL DBMS_STATS.UNLOCK_TABLE_STATS('test', 't1');
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
