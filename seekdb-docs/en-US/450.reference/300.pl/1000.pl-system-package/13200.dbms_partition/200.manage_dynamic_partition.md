# MANAGE_DYNAMIC_PARTITION

`MANAGE_DYNAMIC_PARTITION` is used to perform a dynamic partition management task to precreate future partitions and delete expired partitions for a dynamic partition table.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_PARTITION.MANAGE_DYNAMIC_PARTITION (
    precreate_time VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT NULL,
    time_unit VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT NULL);
```

## Parameters

|      Parameter      |   Description     |
|----------------|-----------|
| precreate_time | Optional. `n {hour \| day \| week \| month \| year}`.<ul><li>The default value is `null`, indicating that the precreate time is not specified.</li><li>When explicitly specified, the larger value between the specified `precreate_time` and the `precreate_time` of the table is used as the precreate time when precreating partitions for a dynamic partition table.</li></ul>|
| time_unit      | Optional. `null \| hour \| day \| week \| month \| year`.<ul><li>The default value is `null`, indicating that the dynamic partition management task is performed for all dynamic partition tables.</li><li>When the value is `hour`, the dynamic partition management task is performed only for tables with `time_unit` set to `hour`.</li><li>When the value is `day`, the dynamic partition management task is performed only for tables with `time_unit` set to `day`.</li><li>When the value is `week`, the dynamic partition management task is performed only for tables with `time_unit` set to `week`.</li><li>When the value is `month`, the dynamic partition management task is performed only for tables with `time_unit` set to `month`.</li><li>When the value is `year`, the dynamic partition management task is performed only for tables with `time_unit` set to `year`.</li></ul>|

## Examples

```sql
CALL DBMS_PARTITION.MANAGE_DYNAMIC_PARTITION();
```

```sql
CALL DBMS_PARTITION.MANAGE_DYNAMIC_PARTITION('3DAY');
```

```sql
CALL DBMS_PARTITION.MANAGE_DYNAMIC_PARTITION('3DAY', 'HOUR');
```
