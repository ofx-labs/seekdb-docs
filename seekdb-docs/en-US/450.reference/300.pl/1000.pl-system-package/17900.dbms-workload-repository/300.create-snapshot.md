# CREATE_SNAPSHOT

The `CREATE_SNAPSHOT` procedure is used to trigger the generation of a snapshot for a cluster.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT(
    flush_level  VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT 'TYPICAL'
);
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| flush_level | Specifies the type of the snapshot. Currently, only the TYPICAL snapshot is supported, which is used to collect most statistical data. |

## Usage

After a user manually creates a snapshot, the timer is reset. For example, in the default case where the interval is 1 hour:

```shell
12:21 The timer triggers the creation of a snapshot.
13:21 The timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot.
13:45 The user manually creates a snapshot.
14:45 The timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot.
```

## Examples

```shell
CALL DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT(flush_level => 'TYPICAL');
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
