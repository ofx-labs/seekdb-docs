# CURRENT_USER

## Syntax

```sql
CURRENT_USER()
```

## Description

seekdb defines a login account by combining the username and hostname. This function returns the string of the login account name, using the utf8mb4 character set.

When you log in to seekdb, seekdb matches the username and hostname. For example, if you create two users `testUser@11.162.%.%` and `demoUser@11.162.%.%`, you can query the `mysql.USER` table to find the following users:

```sql
SELECT USER,HOST FROM mysql.USER ORDER BY USER,HOST;
+------------+----------------+
| user       | host           |
+------------+----------------+
...
| testUser   | 11.162.%.%     |
| demoUser   | 11.162.%.%     |
...
+------------+----------------+
```

In seekdb, different combinations of usernames and hostnames can have different privileges. These combinations are recognized as different users during matching. For example, you can grant the `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges to `'testUser'@'11.162.%.%'` and the `SELECT` privilege to `'demoUser'@'11.162.%.%'`.

```sql
-- Grant the UPDATE and SELECT privileges to the user 'testUser'@'11.162.%.%'
GRANT UPDATE, SELECT ON *.* TO 'testUser'@'11.162.%.%' identified by '********';
-- Refresh and make the user privileges effective
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
-- Grant the SELECT privilege to the user 'demoUser'@'11.162.%.%'
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'demotUser'@'11.162.%.%' identified by '*******';
-- Refresh and make the user privileges effective
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

After you log in to seekdb as the `testUser` user, execute `CURRENT_USER()`. The result is as follows:

```sql
mysql -h11.162.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utestUser -p********

SELECT CURRENT_USER();
+---------------------+
| CURRENT_USER()      |
+---------------------+
| testUser@11.162.%.% |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

After you delete the `testUser'@'11.162.%.%` user, log in to seekdb as the `testUser` user again. The result is as follows:

```sql
DROP USER DROP USER 'testUser'@'11.162.%.%';

mysql -h11.162.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utestUser -p*******

ERROR 1045 (42000): Access denied for user 'testUser'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (using password: YES)
```

## Examples

Query the login user of the current database.

Example: Connect to seekdb as the `demoUser` user. The result is as follows:

```sql
mysql -h11.162.xxx.xxx -P2881 -udemoUser -p********

+---------------------+
| CURRENT_USER()      |
+---------------------+
| demoUser@11.162.%.% |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
