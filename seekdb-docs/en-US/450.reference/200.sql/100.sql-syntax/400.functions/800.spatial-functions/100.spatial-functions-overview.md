# Overview of spatial functions

Spatial functions are a set of specialized functions provided by the seekdb system for processing geographic spatial data. These functions allow users to perform complex spatial queries and analyses at the database level, enabling Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other applications that rely on spatial data to efficiently store, query, and manipulate spatial data.

Here is an overview of the types of spatial functions available in seekdb:

## Types of spatial functions

| Spatial function type                             | Description                                                               |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Create a geometry function](150.create-a-geometry-function.md) | Used to generate instances of geometry data types, such as points, lines, and polygons.                     |
| [Spatial operation functions](200.spatial-operation-functions.md) | Provide functions for basic operations between geometric objects, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.                   |
| [Spatial relation functions](300.spatial-relation-functions.md)  | Functions that determine the spatial relationships between two geometric objects, such as intersection, containment, and adjacency.       |
| [Geometry attribute functions](400.geometry-attribute-functions.md) | Functions used to retrieve attributes of geometric objects, such as area, length, and boundary.           |
| [Geometry conversion functions](500.geometry-conversion-function.md) | Functions used for converting between different geometry data formats, such as from WKB to WKT.             |
| [Spatial analysis functions](600.spatial-analysis-function.md)                           | Functions used for performing complex spatial processing and analysis, such as buffer analysis, merging, and clipping.   |
| [Spatial constructor functions](700.spatial-constructor-function.md)                           | Functions used for constructing new spatial data types and geometric shapes.                   |
| [Spatial accessor functions](800.spatial-accessor-function.md)                         | Functions that provide access to components of spatial data, such as accessing the vertices of a polygon or the start point of a line.   |
| [Spatial format conversion functions](900.spatial-format-conversion-function.md)                       | Functions used for converting between different spatial data representation formats, such as converting geometric objects to text or binary format. |
|[Geometry processing functions](1000.spatial-processing-function.md)|Functions used for performing various operations and transformations on spatial geometric objects, including shape modification, geometric relationship calculations, spatial queries, and other types of spatial analysis. |
