# EXTRACT

## Syntax

```javascript
EXTRACT(unit FROM date)
```

## Description

Returns the specified part of the `date` value as an integer. If multiple parts are specified, all values are concatenated in sequence.

For more information about the `unit` parameter, see [DATE_ADD](../100.date-and-time-functions/900.date-add.md). When `unit` is `WEEK`, the first day of the week is Sunday.

## Examples

```javascript
SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM '2013-01-01'),
     EXTRACT(WEEK FROM '2013-01-06'),
     EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM '2012-03-09'),
     EXTRACT(DAY FROM NOW())\G;
