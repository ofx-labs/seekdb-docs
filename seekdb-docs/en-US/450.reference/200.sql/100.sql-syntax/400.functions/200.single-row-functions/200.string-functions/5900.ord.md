# ORD

## Declaration

```sql
ORD(str)
```

## Description

Returns the ASCII value of the leftmost character in a string. For single-byte encoding, if the leftmost character is a multibyte character, the return value is calculated as follows:

```sql
(1st byte code)
+ (2nd byte code * 256)
+ (3rd byte code * 256^2) ...
```

If the leftmost character is not a multibyte character, `ORD()` returns the same value as the `ASCII()` function.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ORD('China');
+---------------+
| ORD('China') |
+---------------+
|      14989485 |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```
