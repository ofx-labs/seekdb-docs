# EXPORT_SET

## Syntax

```sql
EXPORT_SET(bits,on,off[,separator[,number_of_bits]])
```

## Description

Returns a string where for each bit set in the `bits` value, the string `on` is added, and for each bit not set in the `bits` value, the string `off` is added. The bits are checked from right to left (least significant to most significant).

The strings are added to the result from left to right, separated by the `separator` string (default is the comma character ","). The number of bits to check is given by `number_of_bits`, which defaults to 64 if not specified. If `number_of_bits` is greater than 64, it will be silently truncated to 64. `number_of_bits` is treated as an unsigned integer, so the value -1 is equivalent to 64.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT EXPORT_SET(6, '1','0',',', 10);
+--------------------------------+
| EXPORT_SET(6, '1','0',',', 10) |
+--------------------------------+
| 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0            |
+--------------------------------+
