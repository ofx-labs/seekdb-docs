# NEG

## Declaration

```sql
NEG(expr)
```

## Description

The NEG function performs a negation operation on the operand, which is equivalent to subtracting the operand from zero. The result is returned as the negated value of the operand.

It supports comparison operations, returning a BOOL value that is then converted to a numeric type. The result is either `1` (`TRUE`) or `0` (`FALSE`), and the negation of this result is returned.

## Example

```sql
SELECT NEG(1), NEG(1+1), NEG(2*3), NEG(1=1), NEG(5<1);
+--------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| NEG(1) | NEG(1+1) | NEG(2*3) | NEG(1=1) | NEG(5<1) |
+--------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
|     -1 |       -2 |       -6 |       -1 |        0 |
+--------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
