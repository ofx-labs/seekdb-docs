# ATAN2

## Declaration

```sql
ATAN2(X,Y)
```

## Description

Returns the arctangent of `X` and `Y`. It is similar to computing the arctangent of `Y/X`, with the signs of both parameters used to determine the quadrant of the result.

This function can also be written as `ATAN(X,Y)`. See [ATAN](../400.mathematical-functions/400.atan.md).

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ATAN(PI(),0);
+--------------------+
| ATAN(PI(),0)       |
