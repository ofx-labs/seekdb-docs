# Map decision functions

Map decision functions/operators perform a judgment on the input map data and return a Boolean value. seekdb currently supports the `=` and `!=` operators.

## =/!=

The `=` and `!=` operators determine whether two map data are equal. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
map1 = map2;
map1 != map2;
```

The input parameters are described as follows:

* `map1` must be a map type.
* `map2` must be a map type.

The returned results are described as follows:

* For `=`, `1` indicates equality, and `0` indicates inequality.
* For `!=`, `0` indicates equality, and `1` indicates inequality.
* Two maps are considered equal only when their keys and values are all equal.

Here are some examples:

```sql
SELECT map(1,"a",2,"b") = map(1,"a",2,"b");
+-------------------------------------+
| map(1,"a",2,"b") = map(1,"a",2,"b") |
+-------------------------------------+
|                                   1 |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

```sql
-- When comparing, the system automatically converts arrays to comparable types
SELECT map(1,"a",2,"b") = map("1","a","2","b");
+-----------------------------------------+
| map(1,"a",2,"b") = map("1","a","2","b") |
+-----------------------------------------+
|                                       1 |
+-----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

```sql
-- When the keys are equal but the values are not, 0 is returned
SELECT map(1,"a",2,"b") = map(1,"a",2,"c");
+-------------------------------------+
| map(1,"a",2,"b") = map(1,"a",2,"c") |
+-------------------------------------+
|                                   0 |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```
