# GROUPING

## Declaration

```sql
GROUPING(expr)
```

## Description

`GROUP BY` can use the `WITH ROLLUP` clause to aggregate each group to represent a higher-level aggregation (also known as super-aggregation), and generate additional rows. For example, the following SQL groups sales by year and outputs the aggregated results for each group.

Rows where `year` is `NULL` are super-aggregation rows.

```sql
SELECT year, SUM(profit) AS profit
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP;
+------+--------+
| year | profit |
+------+--------+
| 2000 |   4525 |
| 2001 |   3010 |
| NULL |   7535 |
+------+--------+
```

When `WITH ROLLUP` is used with multiple `GROUP BY` columns, the results become more complex. In this case, each group will generate a super-aggregation row. For example, the following SQL generates additional super-aggregation rows.

```sql
SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit) AS profit
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| year | country | product    | profit |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |    100 |
| 2000 | Finland | NULL       |   1600 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |    150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |   1200 |
| 2000 | India   | NULL       |   1350 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |     75 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |   1500 |
| 2000 | USA     | NULL       |   1575 |
| 2000 | NULL    | NULL       |   4525 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |     10 |
| 2001 | Finland | NULL       |     10 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |     50 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |   2700 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |    250 |
| 2001 | USA     | NULL       |   3000 |
| 2001 | NULL    | NULL       |   3010 |
| NULL | NULL    | NULL       |   7535 |
+------+---------+------------+--------+
```

The `GROUPING` function is used to distinguish super-aggregation rows. If the row is a super-aggregation row, the function returns `1`; otherwise, it returns `0`.

For example, the following SQL uses the `GROUPING` function to add a condition to identify super-aggregation rows.

```sql
SELECT
   IF(GROUPING(year), 'All years', year) AS year,
   IF(GROUPING(country), 'All countries', country) AS country,
   IF(GROUPING(product), 'All products', product) AS product,
   SUM(profit) AS profit
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------+
| year      | country       | product      | profit |
+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------+
