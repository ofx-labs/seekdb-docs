# Overview

This chapter describes the built-in functions of seekdb.

## Single-row functions

Single-row functions return a single row of result. They include date and time functions, string functions, conversion functions, mathematical functions, comparison functions, and control flow functions.

## Aggregate functions

An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value. An aggregate function ignores null values. An aggregate function is often used with the `GROUP BY` clause in a `SELECT` statement.

All aggregate functions are deterministic. They return the same value when called with the same set of input values.

In seekdb, only one value expression can be specified in an aggregate function. For example, `COUNT(c1, c2)` is not supported, but `COUNT(c1)` is supported.

## Analytic functions

Analytic functions (also known as window functions in some databases) are similar to aggregate functions. An analytic function performs a calculation on a set of rows, but it can return multiple rows for each group. Each row in the group is calculated based on the window logic. Analytic functions can significantly optimize queries that require self-joins.

A window is also called a frame. seekdb supports both `ROWS` and `RANGE` frame semantics. The `ROWS` frame is based on physical row offsets, while the `RANGE` frame is based on logical value offsets.

## Encryption functions

Encryption functions are used for encrypting and decrypting data. They include encryption and decryption functions.

## Information functions

Information functions are used for returning specified system information.

## JSON functions

JSON functions are used for creating, operating on, and searching JSON values.

## XML functions

XML functions are used for processing and analyzing XML data.

## Spatial functions

Spatial functions are used for processing and analyzing spatial data. Spatial functions can be used with geospatial data.

## Lock functions

Lock functions are used for operating on locks.

## Bitmap functions

Bitmap functions are used for processing compressed bitmap data.

## Array functions

Array functions are used for processing and analyzing array data.

## Other functions

Other functions include some functions that are difficult to classify.
