## Syntax

```sql
RELEASE_LOCK('str')
```

## Description

### Parameters

`str`: The name of the lock to be released. It is a string.

### Return Value

* Returns 1: Indicates that the current session holds the lock and it has been successfully released.
* Returns 0: Indicates that the current session does not hold the lock, and the lock has not been released by the current session.
* Returns `NULL`: Indicates that the lock does not exist, i.e., it was not obtained by the `GET_LOCK()` function, or it was released earlier.

## Examples

Release the lock named `my_lock`.

```shell
SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('my_lock');
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------+
| RELEASE_LOCK('my_lock') |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
