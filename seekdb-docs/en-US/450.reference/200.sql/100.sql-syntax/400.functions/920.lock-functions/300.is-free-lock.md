# IS_FREE_LOCK

## Description

This function checks whether the lock named by the string `str` is free, i.e., whether the named lock is held by any session.

## Syntax

```sql
IS_FREE_LOCK('str')
```

## Examples

### Parameters

`str`: the name of the lock to check. The value is a string.

### Return value

* Returns 1: the lock is free, i.e., no session holds the lock.

* Returns 0: the lock is not free, i.e., some session holds the lock.

## Examples

Check whether the lock named `my_lock` is available.

```shell
SELECT IS_FREE_LOCK('my_lock');
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------+
| IS_FREE_LOCK('my_lock') |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

The result is 0, indicating that the lock `my_lock` is held by some session. You can execute `IS_USED_LOCK()` to query the session identifier (session ID) of the session that holds the lock. Example:

```shell
SELECT IS_USED_LOCK('my_lock');
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------+
| IS_USED_LOCK('my_lock') |
+-------------------------+
|              3221487701 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```
