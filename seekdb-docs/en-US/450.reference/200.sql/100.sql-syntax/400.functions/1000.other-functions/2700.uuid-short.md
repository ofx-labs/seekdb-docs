# UUID_SHORT

## Syntax

```sql
UUID_SHORT()
```

## Description

Returns a "short" universal identifier in the form of a 64-bit unsigned integer.

The return value of `UUID_SHORT()` is guaranteed to be unique if the following conditions are met:

* The `server_id` value of the current server is between 0 and 255 and is unique among the source and replica servers. If the total number of `server_id` values exceeds 256, the generated "short" universal identifier cannot be guaranteed to be unique in space, although this function will not return an error.

* Do not set the system time of the server host during seekdb restart.

* During seekdb restart, the average number of calls to `UUID_SHORT()` per second is less than 16 million.

The return value of `UUID_SHORT()` is constructed as follows:

```sql
(server_id & 255) << 56
+ (server_startup_time_in_seconds << 24)
+ incremented_variable++;
```

## Examples

```sql
SELECT UUID_SHORT();

|          UUID_SHORT() |
