# SLEEP

## Syntax

```sql
SLEEP(duration)
```

## Description

The `SLEEP` function pauses for the specified number of seconds (`duration`) and returns `0` after the pause.

* If `SLEEP` is executed alone and not interrupted, it returns `0`.

* If `SLEEP` is executed alone and interrupted, it returns `1` without any error code.

* If `SLEEP` is part of a query and interrupted during the pause, it returns the error code `ERROR 1317`.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT SLEEP(1000);
+------------------+
| SLEEP(1000) |
+------------------+
|          0 |
+------------------+

SELECT SLEEP(1000);
+------------------+
| SLEEP(1000) |
+------------------+
|          1 |
+------------------+

SELECT 1 FROM t1 WHERE SLEEP(1000);
ERROR 1317 (70100): Query execution was interrupted
