# NUMBER type conversion rules

The storage format of the `NUMBER` type in seekdb is the same, but it can be divided into four formats based on the value domain definition, as shown in the following table.

| Storage type | Default storage rules in seekdb |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed-point number `DECIMAL(M,D) = {10^{-D}*i &#124; i = 0,1,...,10^M-1}` where M is a natural number and D is an integer | <ul><li> DECIMAL = DECIMAL(10, 0)</li> <li>DECIMAL(M) = DECIMAL(M, 0)</li> <li> The value range of DECIMAL(M, D) is: 0 \<= D \<= M \<= 65 </li></ul> |
| Unsigned fixed-point number DECIMAL(M,D) | <ul><li> DECIMAL</li> <li> DECIMAL(M)</li> <li> DECIMAL(M,D) </li> <li>Supports the UNSIGNED attribute</li></ul>|
| Floating-point number | Not supported |

The conversion rules between all `NUMBER` types in seekdb are as follows. The "-" in the table indicates that the conversion is not supported across compatibility modes.

:::tip

Unsigned fixed-point numbers exist only in seekdb.

| Instant conversion allowed (From\\To)| Fixed-point number(M2,D2)| Unsigned fixed-point number(M2,D2)| Floating-point number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed-point number(M1,D1)| Conversion condition: D1 \<= D2 and M1-D1 \<= M2-D2| Not supported| Conversion condition: M-D \<= 38 |
| Unsigned fixed-point number(M1,D1) UNSIGNED| Conversion condition: D1 \<= D2 and M1-D1 \<= M2-D2| Conversion condition: D1 \<= D2 and M1-D1 \<= M2-D2| - |
