# Generated column operations

The generated column operations in seekdb include adding, modifying, and dropping `STORED` columns and adding and dropping `VIRTUAL` columns.

## Add a STORED column

The syntax for adding a `STORED` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN (column_name INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS
     (column_expression) STORED);
```

Here is an example of adding a `STORED` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT,c2 VARCHAR(50));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.002 sec)

ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.063 sec)
```

<!--Modify a STORED column

The syntax for modifying a `STORED` column is as follows:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS
     (column_expression) STORED;
```

Here is an example of adding a `STORED` column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 11) STORED;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
-->

## Drop a STORED column

The syntax for dropping a `STORED` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

Here is an example of dropping a `STORED` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.002 sec)
```

## Add a VIRTUAL column

The syntax for adding a `VIRTUAL` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS
     (column_expression) VIRTUAL;
```

Here is an example of adding a `VIRTUAL` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) VIRTUAL);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.013 sec)
```

## Drop a VIRTUAL column

The syntax for dropping a `VIRTUAL` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

Here is an example of dropping a `VIRTUAL` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.006 sec)
```
