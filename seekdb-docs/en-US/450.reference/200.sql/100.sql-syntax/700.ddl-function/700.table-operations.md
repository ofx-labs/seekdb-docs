# Table operations

In seekdb, you can modify the row format, block size, and character set of a table, and rename a table.

## Modify the row format

The syntax for modifying the row format is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ROW_FORMAT = {DEFAULT | DYNAMIC | FIXED | COMPRESSED | REDUNDANT | COMPACT};
```

The syntax for modifying the row format is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 ROW_FORMAT = COMPRESSED;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)
```

## Modify the block size

The syntax for modifying the block size is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name BLOCK_SIZE = value;
```

Here is an example of modifying the block size:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 BLOCK_SIZE = 1024;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.002 sec)
```

## Change the character set

The syntax for changing the character set is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET charset_name;
```

Here is an example of changing the character set:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_collation CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.003 sec)
```

## Rename a table

The syntax for renaming a table is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE old_tbl_name RENAME TO new_tbl_name;
```

Here is an example of renaming a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME TO t2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.008 sec)
```
