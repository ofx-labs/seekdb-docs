# CREATE OUTLINE

## Description

This statement is used to create an outline. You can create an outline in two ways: using `SQL_TEXT` (the original statement with parameters executed by the user) or using `SQL_ID`.

  :::info

  To create an outline, you must execute the statement in the corresponding database.

  :::

When `SQL_ID` is the same, the outline created using `SQL_TEXT` will overwrite the outline created using `SQL_ID`. The outline created using `SQL_ID` has a higher priority.

Additionally, SeekDB distinguishes different SQL statements based on `SQL_ID`, which is obtained by taking the MD5 hash of `SQL_TEXT`. Even if the SQL text is the same but has an extra newline or tab, the resulting `SQL_ID` will be different. In a production system, it is recommended to bind outlines using `SQL_ID`.

## Syntax

* Create an outline using `SQL_TEXT`.

  ```sql
  CREATE [OR REPLACE] OUTLINE outline_name ON stmt [ TO target_stmt ]
  ```

* Create an outline using `SQL_ID`.

  ```sql
  CREATE OUTLINE outline_name ON sql_id USING HINT hint;
  ```

## Parameter Description

|     **Parameter**     |    **Description**     |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| outline_name   | Specifies the name of the outline to be created.    |
| OR REPLACE     | If specified, the existing outline with the same name will be replaced when creating a new one.   |
| stmt           | Generally, a DML statement with hints and original parameters.  |
| TO target_stmt | If `TO target_stmt` is not specified, it means that if the parameterized SQL accepted by the database is the same as `stmt` after removing the hint parameters, the SQL will be bound to the hint in `stmt` to generate an execution plan. If you want to fix the plan for a statement with hints, you need to use `TO target_stmt` to specify the original SQL. <br />**Note**  When using `target_stmt`, it is strictly required that `stmt` and `target_stmt` match exactly after removing the hints. |
| sql_id         | If the SQL statement corresponding to `sql_id` already has hints, the hints specified when creating the outline will overwrite all hints in the original statement.   |
| hint           | The format is `/*+ xxx */`.           |

## Examples

* Create an outline using `SQL_TEXT`.

  ```sql
  CREATE OUTLINE otl_idx_c2
  ON SELECT/*+ index(t1 idx_c2)*/ * FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 1;
  ```

* Create an outline using `SQL_ID`.

  ```sql
  CREATE OUTLINE otl_idx_c2
  ON 'ED570339F2C856BA96008A29EDF04C74'
  USING HINT /*+ index(t1 idx_c2)*/ ;
  ```
