* View the usage of the `KILL` statement.

  ```sql
  HELP 'KILL';
  Name: 'KILL'
  Description:

    Syntax:

    KILL [GLOBAL | LOCAL] [CONNECTION | QUERY] 'sessionid'

    Each connection to OceanBase Database runs in an independent thread. You can use the SHOW PROCESSLIST; statement to view the running threads and use the KILL thread_id statement to terminate a thread.

  • KILL CONNECTION is the same as KILL without a modifier: it terminates the thread with the specified thread_id.

  • KILL QUERY terminates the statement currently being executed by the connection, but keeps the connection intact.
  If you have the PROCESS privilege, you can view all threads. If you have the SUPER privilege, you can terminate all threads and statements. Otherwise, you can only view and terminate your own threads and statements.
  ```

  ```sql

  Name: 'SELECT'

    SELECT
