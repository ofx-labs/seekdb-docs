# LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE

## Description

This statement is used to load an index into the cache to improve query performance. It allows multiple indexes to be loaded into the cache at once, rather than loading each index individually. This reduces the system overhead during index loading and improves overall performance.

## Syntax

```sql
LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE tbl_index_list [, tbl_index_list ...];

tbl_index_list:
    tbl_name [PARTITION (partition_list)] [{INDEX|KEY} (index_name[, index_name ...])] [IGNORE LEAVES]

partition_list:
    partition_name [, partition_name ...]
    | ALL
```
