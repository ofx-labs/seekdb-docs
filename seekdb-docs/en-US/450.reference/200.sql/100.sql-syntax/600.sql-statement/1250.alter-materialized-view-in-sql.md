# ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW

## Description

This statement is used to modify the properties of a materialized view.

## Privilege requirements

To execute the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement, the current user must have the `ALTER` privilege on the object to be modified. For more information about privileges in seekdb, see [Privilege classification in seekdb](../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.permission-classification.md).

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW [database.]view_name alter_mview_action_list;

alter_mview_action_list:
    alter_mview_action [, alter_mview_action ...]

alter_mview_action:
    parallel_clause
    | REFRESH [nested_refresh_option] [[START WITH expr] [NEXT expr]]

parallel_clause:
    NOPARALLEL
    | PARALLEL integer

nested_refresh_option:
    INDIVIDUAL
    | INCONSISTENT
    | CONSISTENT
```

## Parameters

|        **Parameter**         |       **Description**           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| database.               | Optional. Specifies the database where the materialized view is located. If you omit `database.`, the materialized view is assumed to be in the database to which the current session is connected.|
| view_name               | Specifies the name of the materialized view to be modified.<br/>You can rename a materialized view by using the `RENAME TABLE` command. |
| alter_mview_action_list | Specifies the list of operations that can be performed to modify the materialized view. You can specify multiple operations, separated by commas (`,`). For more information, see [alter_mview_action](#alter_mview_action) below.|

### alter_mview_action

* `parallel_clause`: specifies the refresh parallelism of the materialized view. Valid values:

  * `NOPARALLEL`: default value. The parallelism is 1.
  * `PARALLEL integer`: specifies the parallelism. The value of `integer` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.

  **Example:**

  ```sql
  ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1 PARALLEL 5;
  ```

* `REFRESH [nested_refresh_option] [[START WITH expr] [NEXT expr]]`: specifies the refresh strategy of a nested materialized view or the refresh cycle of the background refresh task of a materialized view.

  * `nested_refresh_option`: optional. Specifies the refresh strategy of a nested materialized view.

    * `INDIVIDUAL`: default value. Independent refresh.
    * `INCONSISTENT`: cascading non-consistent refresh.
    * `CONSISTENT`: cascading consistent refresh.

    **Example:**

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1 REFRESH INDIVIDUAL;
    ```

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1 REFRESH INCONSISTENT;
    ```

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1 REFRESH CONSISTENT;
    ```

  * `[START WITH expr]`: optional. Specifies the start time of the refresh schedule.

  * `[NEXT expr]`: optional. Specifies the next refresh time.

    :::tip

    * If you use the `NEXT` clause, the refresh schedule must be set to a future time. Otherwise, an error will be returned.
    * If you want to schedule the refresh task of a materialized view to be automatically executed periodically, define the `NEXT` clause to set the schedule cycle.

    :::

  We recommend that you use `sysdate()` to represent the current time in the current time zone. The following example shows a time expression:

  ```sql
  START WITH sysdate() NEXT sysdate() + INTERVAL 1 DAY
  ```

  The preceding clause indicates that the materialized view is refreshed every 1 day starting from the current time (`sysdate()`).

  **Example:**

  ```sql
  ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1
      REFRESH START WITH sysdate();
  ```

  ```sql
  ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1
      REFRESH NEXT sysdate() + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
  ```

  ```sql
  ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1
      REFRESH START WITH sysdate() NEXT sysdate() + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
  ```
