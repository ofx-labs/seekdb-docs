# SUBMIT JOB

## Description

This statement is used to create an asynchronous task.

When using `INSERT INTO` or `INSERT OVERWRITE SELECT` to import data, the default execution mode is synchronous. If the data volume is large, this may lead to data import failures. Therefore, in scenarios with large data volumes, it is recommended to submit data import tasks asynchronously.

## Syntax

```sql
SUBMIT JOB sql_statement ;
```

## Limitations

`sql_statement` specifies the SQL statement used by the job. Currently, only simple statements such as `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, `INSERT INTO SELECT`, `INSERT OVERWRITE`, and `LOAD DATA INFILE` are supported.

## Examples

```sql
SUBMIT JOB INSERT OVERWRITE test SELECT * FROM test_external_table;
+------------------------+
| job_id                 |
+------------------------+
| 2010011125899910644432 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.019 sec)
```

where:

* The first five digits `20100` represent the database ID.
* The following digits `11125899910644432` are the globally unique sequence ID.
