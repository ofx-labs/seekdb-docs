# CREATE USER

## Description

The `CREATE USER` statement is used to create a new seekdb user. After a new user is created, you can use the new user to connect to seekdb.

## Privilege requirements

To execute the `CREATE USER` statement, the current user must have the global CREATE USER privilege. For more information about seekdb privileges, see [seekdb privilege classification](../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.permission-classification.md).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] {user [, user...]}
    [REQUIRE {NONE | SSL | X509 | tls_option}]
    [WITH resource_option [resource_option...]];

user:
      user_name
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY password
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY PASSWORD password
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] AS PASSWORD 'auth_string'

tls_option:
      CIPHER cipher_name
    | ISSUER issuer_name
    | SUBJECT subject_name

resource_option:
      MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR integer
    | MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS integer
```

## Parameter description

| Parameter | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| IF NOT EXISTS | Indicates whether to create a user if the username already exists. If you do not specify `IF NOT EXISTS` and the username already exists, an error will be returned. |
| user_name | The username. After a new user is created, a new row will be added to the `mysql.user` table. To create multiple users at a time, separate the usernames with commas (`,`). |
| auth_plugin | The authentication method for the user. Only the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin is supported. |
| IDENTIFIED BY password | The plaintext password for the user. After the password is stored in the `mysql.user` table, it will be encrypted. If the password contains special characters <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>, enclose it in double quotation marks (<code>"</code>) or single quotation marks (<code>'</code>). |
| IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD password | The encrypted password for the user. The password will be directly stored in the `mysql.user` table. |
| IDENTIFIED AS PASSWORD | Sets the account authentication plugin to `auth_plugin` and stores the `auth_string` value in the `mysql.user` table. If the plugin requires a hashed string, it is assumed that the string is already in the required hashed format. |
| REQUIRE | Specifies the password verification requirements for the user. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>NONE: Indicates that the user has no password verification requirements, which means the user can use any password or not set a password.</li><li>SSL: Indicates that the user must use an SSL connection for authentication.</li><li>X509: Indicates that the user must use an X.509 certificate for authentication.</li><li>tls_option: Indicates that the user must meet the specified Transport Layer Security (TLS) requirements.</li></ul> |
| tls_option | Specifies the specific TLS requirements. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>CIPHER: Specifies the encryption algorithm or cipher suite to be used for the TLS connection.</li><li>ISSUER: Specifies the issuer of the TLS certificate.</li><li>SUBJECT: Specifies the subject of the TLS certificate.</li></ul> |
| resource_option | Specifies the resource options for the user. If multiple resource options are specified, separate them with spaces. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR: Specifies the maximum number of connections allowed per hour. integer is an integer that represents the maximum number of connections allowed.</li><li>MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS: Specifies the maximum number of connections allowed per user. integer is an integer that represents the maximum number of connections allowed.</li></ul> |

## Examples

* Create users test1 and test2, and specify plaintext passwords and the maximum number of connections allowed for each user.

  ```sql
  CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test1 IDENTIFIED BY '********', test2 IDENTIFIED BY '********' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
  ```

* Create user test3, specify an encrypted password, and require the use of an SSL connection for authentication.

  ```sql
  CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test3 IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '********' REQUIRE SSL;
  ```

* Create user test4, and specify the use of the mysql_native_password authentication plugin.

  ```sql
  CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test4 IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY PASSWORD '********';
  ```
