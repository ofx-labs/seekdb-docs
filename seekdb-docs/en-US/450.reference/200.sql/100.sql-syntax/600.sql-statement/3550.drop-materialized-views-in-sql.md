# DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW

## Description

This statement is used to drop a materialized view.

## Privilege requirements

To drop a materialized view log, you must have the `DROP TABLE` privilege. For more information about seekdb privileges, see [seekdb privilege types](../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.permission-classification.md).

## Syntax

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [IF EXISTS] materialized_view_list [opt_drop_behavior];

materialized_view_list:
    [ database. ]materialized_view [,[ database. ]materialized_view]...

opt_drop_behavior:
    RESTRICT | CASCADE
```

## Parameters

|       **Parameter**    |       **Description**           |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| IF EXISTS         | Optional. If you specify `IF EXISTS`, the statement will not throw an error if the materialized view does not exist. If you do not specify this option, an error will be thrown if the materialized view does not exist. |
| database.         | Optional. Specifies the database where the materialized view is located. If you omit `database.`, the materialized view will be dropped in your default database.|
| materialized_view | The name of the materialized view.|
| RESTRICT \| CASCADE | Optional. Specifies the behavior of the drop operation.<ul><li>CASCADE is the default value. It means that when you drop a materialized view, all dependent objects are also dropped. </li><li>RESTRICT means that if there are other objects dependent on the materialized view, the drop operation is not allowed. </li></ul>|

## Examples

Drop the materialized view named `mv_test_tbl1` in the `test_db` database.

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_test_tbl1;
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)
```
