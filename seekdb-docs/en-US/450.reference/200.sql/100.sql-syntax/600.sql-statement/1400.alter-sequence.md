# ALTER SEQUENCE

## Description

This statement is used to change the increment, minimum, and maximum values, cache size, and behavior of an existing sequence. The changes only affect subsequent sequence numbers.

  :::info
  Users can only operate on sequences in their own schema or those for which they have the `ALTER` object privilege.
  :::

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE [ schema. ] sequence_name
{ RESTART [ START WITH int_value ]
|[ MINVALUE int_value | NOMINVALUE ]
|[ MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE ]
|[ INCREMENT BY int_value ]
|[ CACHE int_value | NOCACHE ]
|[ ORDER | NOORDER ]
|[ CYCLE | NOCYCLE]
}
;
```

## Parameter Description

|   Parameter    |    Description                            |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| schema.   | Specifies the schema containing the sequence. If omitted, the database will modify the sequence in the current user's schema.  |
| sequence_name   | The name of the sequence to be modified.    |
| RESTART   | Resets the sequence value. When ascending, it starts from `MINVALUE`; when descending, it starts from `MAXVALUE`; or, you can use `START WITH int_value` to start from `int_value`.    |
| MINVALUE int_value     | Changes the minimum value of the sequence. The range of `int_value` is \[-(10<sup>27</sup>-1) \~ (10<sup>27</sup>-1)\].   |
| NOMINVALUE   | If changed to `NOMINVALUE`, the minimum value is 1 when ascending and -(10<sup>27</sup>-1) when descending.  |
| MAXVALUE int_value     | Changes the maximum value of the sequence. The range of `int_value` is \[(-10<sup>27</sup>+1) \~ (10<sup>28</sup>-1)\]. The new `MAXVALUE` must be greater than or equal to the current sequence number. <br/>**Note**  *When both `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` are specified, `MINVALUE` must be less than `MAXVALUE`. Additionally, the difference between `MAXVALUE` and `MINVALUE` must be greater than or equal to the `int_value` specified in INCREMENT BY.*    |
| NOMAXVALUE             | If changed to `NOMAXVALUE`, the maximum value is (10<sup>28</sup>-1) when ascending and -1 when descending.  |
| INCREMENT BY int_value | Changes the increment step of the sequence. `int_value` cannot be 0. If specified as a positive number, the sequence is ascending; if specified as a negative number, the sequence is descending. The default value is 1 if not specified.          |
| CACHE int_value        | Changes the number of increment values pre-allocated in memory. The default value of `int_value` is 20. `CACHE int_value` must be greater than 1. If `CACHE INT_VALUE` is set to 1, it is equivalent to `NOCACHE`.   |
| NOCACHE                | Changes the sequence value to not be pre-allocated. If both `CACHE` and `NOCACHE` are omitted, the database will cache 20 sequence numbers by default.   |
| ORDER      | Changes the sequence value to be generated in order.  |
| NOORDER     | If changed to `NOORDER`, the sequence value is not guaranteed to be generated in order.   |
| CYCLE   | Changes the sequence value to be generated in a cycle. That is, the sequence continues to generate values after reaching its maximum or minimum value. When ascending, it generates the minimum value after reaching the maximum value. When descending, it generates the maximum value after reaching the minimum value. <br/>**Note**  <ul><li> If `CYCLE` is specified and `INCREMENT BY` is a negative number, `MINVALUE` must be specified. </li>   <li> If `CYCLE` is specified, the number of `CACHE` values cannot exceed one cycle. </li></ul>                           |
| NOCYCLE   | The default value is `NOCYCLE`. If changed to `NOCYCLE`, the sequence cannot generate more values after reaching its maximum or minimum value. |

## Examples

* Modify the maximum value of the auto-increment column `seq1` and specify that the increment values are generated in a cycle.

  ```shell
  ALTER SEQUENCE seq1 MAXVALUE 1024 CYCLE;
  ```

  ```shell
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)
  ```

* Change the maximum value and increment step of the sequence `seq3`, enable `CYCLE` and `ORDER`, and specify `NOCACHE` to indicate that the sequence values are not pre-allocated.

  ```shell
  ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 MAXVALUE 1500 INCREMENT BY 5 CYCLE NOCACHE ORDER;
  ```

  ```shell
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)
  ```

* Reset the sequence value and start from 3.

  ```shell
  ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 RESTART;
  ```

  ```shell
  ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 RESTART START WITH 3;
  ```

* The position of `RESTART` can be anywhere among the options. The following two shell statements that reset the sequence value are equivalent.

  ```shell
  ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 START WITH 3 RESTART MINVALUE  -100 CYCLE;
  ```

  ```shell
  ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 RESTAR START WITH 3 T MINVALUE  -100 CYCLE;
  ```
