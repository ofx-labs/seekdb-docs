# THROTTLE

## Description

This statement is used to throttle SQL requests based on specific features. It allows requests that meet the throttling criteria to fail early, preventing them from affecting normal requests.

## Syntax

```sql
alter_system_throttle_stmt:
    ALTER SYSTEM throttle_action;

throttle_action:
      ENABLE SQL THROTTLE [priority_option] [using_metric_option_list]
    | DISABLE SQL

priority_option:
    FOR PRIORITY <= INT_VALUE

using_metric_option_list:
    USING metric_option_list

metric_option_list:
    metric_option [metric_option ...]

metric_option:
      RT = {INT_VALUE | DECIMAL_VALUE}
    | CPU = {INT_VALUE | DECIMAL_VALUE}
    | IO = INT_VALUE
    | NETWORK = {INT_VALUE | DECIMAL_VALUE}
    | QUEUE_TIME = {INT_VALUE | DECIMAL_VALUE}
    | LOGICAL_READS = {INT_VALUE | DECIMAL_VALUE}
```

## Parameters

|    **Parameter**   |      **Description**          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| ENABLE SQL    | Enables throttling, followed by the throttling feature and its value.    |
| FOR PRIORITY  | Specifies the priority level affected by throttling, ensuring that throttling only affects certain sessions. You can set the priority for the current session using the session-level variable `sql_throttle_priority`, which defaults to -1. For example, if sessions `a`, `b`, and `c` have priorities `1`, `2`, and `3` respectively, setting `ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE SQL THROTTLE FOR PRIORITY <= 2 USING QUEUE_TIME=0.1;` means that sessions `a` and `b` are affected by throttling, while session `c` is not. |
| RT            | Throttles based on SQL response time (Response Time). Unit: seconds.    |
| CPU           | Throttles based on CPU usage. <br/>This parameter is not supported in the current version.  |
| IO            | Throttles based on I/O operations. <br/>This parameter is not supported in the current version. |
| NETWORK       | Throttles based on the amount of network traffic transmitted.  <br/>This parameter is not supported in the current version.  |
| QUEUE_TIME    | Throttles based on queue wait time. Unit: seconds.    |
| LOGICAL_READS | Throttles based on the number of logical reads. <br/>This parameter is not supported in the current version. |
| DISABLE SQL   | Disables throttling.  |

## Examples

Throttle requests with a queue wait time exceeding `0.1s` for sessions with a priority less than or equal to `100`.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE SQL THROTTLE FOR PRIORITY <= 100 USING QUEUE_TIME=0.1;
```
