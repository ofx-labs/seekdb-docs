# ALTER OUTLINE

## Description

This statement is used to add throttling rules and bind outlines. It only supports modifying outlines created using the `SQL_TEXT` option.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER OUTLINE outline_name ADD stmt [ TO target_stmt ];
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------------|----------------|
| outline_name   | The name of the outline to be modified.     |
| stmt           | A DML statement that typically includes hints and original parameters.         |
| TO target_stmt | If `TO target_stmt` is not specified, it means that if the SQL statement, after parameterization, matches the `stmt` statement with hints removed, the SQL statement will be bound to the execution plan generated by the hints in `stmt`. If you want to fix the execution plan for a statement with hints, you need to use `TO target_stmt` to specify the original SQL statement.  <br/>**Notice:** When using `target_stmt`, the `stmt` and `target_stmt` statements must be identical after removing the hints. |

## Examples

* Add a throttling rule using `ALTER OUTLINE`.

  ```sql
  ALTER OUTLINE ol_1 ADD SELECT /*+max_concurrent(1)*/ * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 1 and c2 = ?;
  ALTER OUTLINE ol_1 ADD SELECT /*+max_concurrent(1)*/ * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = ? and c2 = 1;
  ```

* Add an execution plan using `ALTER OUTLINE`.

  ```sql
  CREATE OUTLINE ol_2 ON SELECT /*+max_concurrent(1)*/ * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.c1 = 1;
  ALTER OUTLINE ol_2 ADD SELECT /*+use_nl(t2)*/ * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.c1 = 1;
  ```

## Considerations

* Only one execution plan can be specified for the same `outline_name`. If an execution plan is specified using the `CREATE OUTLINE` statement, it cannot be added again when executing `ALTER OUTLINE`.

* Similar to `CREATE OUTLINE`, you cannot specify both throttling rules and execution plans at the same time when using `ALTER OUTLINE`.
