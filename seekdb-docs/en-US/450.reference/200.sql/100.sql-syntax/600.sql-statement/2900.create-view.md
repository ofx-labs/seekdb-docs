# CREATE VIEW

## Description

This statement is used to create a view.

## Limitations and Considerations

* A view is not stored as a table in the database. It is derived from the `SELECT` statement specified in the `CREATE VIEW` statement. Each time it is used, the view is derived.

* If two or more tables or views are referenced in the `FROM` clause, the view is called a join view. An updatable join view, also known as a modifiable join view, involves two or more base tables or views and allows DML operations. Updatable views are not limited by the `WITH READ ONLY` clause.

* To ensure the updatable nature of a view, a series of specific conditions must be met. One of the universally applicable rules is that when performing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on a join view, the operations can only modify a single base table.

## Permissions

To execute the `CREATE VIEW` statement, the current user must have the `CREATE VIEW` permission. For more information about seekdb permissions, see [seekdb Permission Classification](../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.permission-classification.md).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name[(column_name_list)]
    AS select_stmt
    [check_option];

column_name_list:
    column_name [, column_name ...]

check_option:
    WITH CHECK OPTION
    | WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION
    | WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION
```

## Parameter Description

|      **Parameter**    |                     **Description**                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE       | Optional. Specifies that if a view with the specified name already exists, it will be replaced with the new definition.|
| view_name        | Specifies the name of the view.|
| column_name_list | Optional. Specifies the list of column names for the view. If not specified, the column names retrieved by the `SELECT` statement will be used as the view's column names. The columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement can be simple references to table columns or expressions involving functions, constants, operators, etc. View column names have the following restrictions:<ul><li>Column names must be unique and cannot be repeated.</li><li>The number of names in `column_name_list` must equal the number of columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement.</li></ul>|
| select_stmt      | The query (`SELECT`) statement used to define the view. It specifies the view's definition, allowing selection from base tables or other views. For specific structures and options of the query statement, see [SELECT Statement](8100.select/100.select.md).|
| check_option | Optional. Specifies the check scope for the view, used to restrict insert and update operations on the view. For more details on the check scope, see [check_option](#check_option) below.|

### check_option

`WITH CHECK OPTION`: A syntax for creating a view that ensures the data inserted or updated meets the view's definition conditions. In MySQL mode, the `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause can also be used with the `LOCAL/CASCADED` keywords to further specify the scope of data checks.

* `WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION`: Checks the current view and recursively checks all referenced views.

* `WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION`: Checks the current view. Whether to check the referenced views depends on their definitions.

## Examples

1. Create a table named `test_tbl1`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test_tbl1 (col1 INT, col2 INT);
   ```

2. Create a view named `v1` based on the `test_tbl1` table.

   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW v1
       AS SELECT * FROM test_tbl1 WHERE col2 < 2
       WITH CHECK OPTION;
   ```

3. Create a view named `v2` based on the `v1` view using the `LOCAL CHECK OPTION` syntax.

   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW v2
       AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE col2 > 0
       WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;
   ```

4. Create a view named `v3` based on the `v1` view using the `CASCADED CHECK OPTION` syntax.

   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW v3
       AS SELECT * FROM v1 WHERE col2 > 0
       WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;
   ```
