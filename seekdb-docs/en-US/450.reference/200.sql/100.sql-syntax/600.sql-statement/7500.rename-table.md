# RENAME TABLE

## Description

This statement is used to rename one or more tables.

## Limitations and Considerations

* During the table renaming process, the system automatically locks the tables and prevents any other threads from reading these tables until the renaming is complete.

* If there are ongoing active transactions on the target table, the renaming operation will wait. The renaming process cannot proceed until all active transactions are either committed or rolled back.

* If this statement is used to rename multiple tables, the renaming operation proceeds from left to right.

* When executing `RENAME TABLE`, there should be no locked tables and no active transactions.

   :::info
   After enabling the [enable_lock_priority](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000002973869) configuration item, `RENAME TABLE` has the highest lock priority.
   :::

* `RENAME TABLE` can be used for views but does not support moving them to other databases.

* During the `RENAME TABLE` operation, table locking and read/write defense measures are added, which will increase the operation time. To avoid affecting other users' DDL operations, it is recommended not to perform batch `RENAME TABLE` operations.

## Privileges

This operation requires the `ALTER` and `DROP` privileges on the original table, as well as the `CREATE` and `INSERT` privileges on the new table.

## Syntax

```sql
RENAME TABLE table_name TO [new_database_name.]new_table_name
   [, table_name2 TO [new_database_name.]new_table_name2 ...];
```

## Parameters

|                               **Parameter**                                |                                  **Description**                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| table_name                                                          | The original table name.                                                                      |
| new_table_name                                                      | The new table name.                                                                      |
| table_name  TO \[new_database_name.\]new_table_name | When renaming multiple tables, separate them with commas (,). You can specify `new_database_name` to move the table to another database. |

## Examples

1. Create tables `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT);
   CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT);
   ```

2. Rename table `t1` to `t11`.

   ```sql
   RENAME TABLE t1 TO t11;
   ```

3. Rename table `t11` to `t111` and table `t2` to `t22`.

   ```sql
   RENAME TABLE t11 TO t111, t2 TO t22;
   ```

4. Move table `t22` to the `mysql` database.

   ```sql
   RENAME TABLE t22 TO mysql.t22;
   ```
