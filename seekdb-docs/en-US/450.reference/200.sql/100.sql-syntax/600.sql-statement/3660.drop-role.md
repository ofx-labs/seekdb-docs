# DROP ROLE

## Description

This statement is used to drop a role.

## Limitations and Considerations

* When a role is dropped, the system automatically revokes the role from all users and roles that have been granted the role and then drops the role from the database.
* Roles specified in the `mandatory_roles` system variable cannot be dropped.
* When multiple roles are dropped at the same time, if any role cannot be dropped successfully, the entire drop operation will be rolled back, and none of the roles will be dropped.

## Privileges

To drop a role, the current user must have the `CREATE USER` or `DROP ROLE` privilege. For more information about seekdb privileges, see [seekdb Privilege Types](../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.permission-classification.md).

## Syntax

```sql
DROP ROLE role_name [, role_name ...];
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------|----------|
| role_name | The name of the role to be dropped. When dropping multiple roles, separate the role names with commas (`,`). |

## Examples

Drop the `role001` role.

```sql
DROP ROLE role001;
```
