# CANCEL JOB

Cancels an asynchronous task.

:::tip
* To execute the `CANCEL JOB` statement, you must specify the `job_id`.
* A running task is terminated. A task that has not started will not be executed.
* If you execute the `cancel job` statement for a task that has already completed, an `ERROR 4018 (HY000): Entry not exist` error is returned.
* After a task is canceled, you can still view the task status.
