# DROP VIEW

## Description

This statement is used to drop one or more views.

## Limitations and Considerations

When dropping multiple views, the current user must have the `DROP` permission on each view.

## Permissions

To execute the `DROP VIEW` statement, the current user must have the `DROP` permission. For more information about seekdb permissions, see [seekdb permission types](../../../../400.guides/500.manage/300.security/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.permission-classification.md).

## Syntax

```sql
DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] view_name_list [CASCADE | RESTRICT];

view_name_list:
    view_name [, view_name ...]
```

## Parameters

|       **Parameter**      |                    **Description**                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| IF EXISTS           | Optional. If this parameter is specified, the drop operation is performed only if the view exists. If the view does not exist, the operation is ignored. |
| view_name_list      | The list of view names to be dropped. You can drop one or more views. If `view_name_list` contains both existing and non-existing views, an error may be returned, but the existing views will still be dropped. |
| view_name           | The name of the view. |
| CASCADE \| RESTRICT | Optional. Specifies the drop option. Valid values:<ul><li>`CASCADE`: Drops the view and all dependent objects. </li><li>`RESTRICT`: Drops the view only if there are no dependent objects. </li></ul> :::tip The current version only supports the syntax of the drop option, but the feature is not effective. ::: |

## Examples

* Drop the view `v1`.

  ```sql
  DROP VIEW v1;
  ```

* Drop the views `v2` and `v3`.

  ```sql
  DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v2, v3;
  ```

* Drop the views without using `IF EXISTS`. If any of the views do not exist, an error will be returned.

  ```sql
  DROP VIEW v1, v4;
  ```

  The return result is as follows:

  ```shell
  ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'test.v1'
  ```
