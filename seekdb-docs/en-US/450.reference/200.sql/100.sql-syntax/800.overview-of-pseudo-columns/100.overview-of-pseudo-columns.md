# Overview of pseudo columns

A pseudo column behaves like a column in a table but does not store specific values. Therefore, pseudo columns have only read properties, and you cannot perform insert, update, or delete operations on them. This chapter describes the pseudo columns supported by the current version of seekdb and their usage.

The current version of seekdb supports the following pseudo columns:

* [PARTITIONID pseudo column](200.partititionid-pseudo-column.md)
* [Sequence pseudo column](300.sequence-pseudo-column.md)
