# Install toolchain

To build OceanBase SeekDB from source code, you need to install the C++ toolchain in your development environment first. If the C++ toolchain is not installed yet, you can follow the instructions in this document for installation.

## Supported OS

OceanBase makes strong assumption on the underlying operating systems. Not all the operating systems are supported; especially, Windows and Mac OS X are not supported yet.

Below is the OS compatibility list:
